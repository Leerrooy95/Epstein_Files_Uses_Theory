# Arkansas Infrastructure Consolidation: Forensic Audit Research Findings

**Five interconnected elements of Arkansas's data-center-driven energy expansion reveal a legislative architecture designed to fast-track utility investments while limiting regulatory and democratic checks.** Act 373 creates a statutory mechanism that effectively compels the Public Service Commission to approve utility projects through iterative resubmission, Act 548 tailors tax incentives to specific multi-site data center configurations, the PSC's January 2026 order approved a $1.5 billion gas plant it found cost-unreasonable, the primary investor behind the $6 billion AVAIO data center campus remains deliberately undisclosed, and a federal lawsuit challenging restrictions on Arkansas's ballot initiative process—the one democratic mechanism that could override these legislative changes—is now on appeal.

## 1. PSC Docket 25-047-U: Approving What the Commission Itself Found Unreasonable

The Arkansas Public Service Commission issued its order on **January 28, 2026**, approving Entergy Arkansas's application to construct the **Jefferson Power Station (JPS)**—a **754-MW combined cycle combustion turbine** natural gas plant adjacent to the White Bluff site near Redfield, Jefferson County. The order explicitly found the project's anticipated cost of **$1.5 billion** to be **"not reasonable,"** yet approved construction anyway.

The full text of the order remains behind the APSC's e-filing system (Docket 25-047-U) and news coverage is paywalled. The accessible snippet from the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette (January 28, 2026, by Sydney Sasser) confirms: *"The Arkansas Public Service Commission on Wednesday approved Entergy Arkansas' application to build the Jefferson Power Station, but found the anticipated cost of the project, now $1.5 billion, as not reasonable."* The Arkansas Times published additional coverage on January 29, 2026, also behind access restrictions.

**The approval defied the recommendations of nearly every independent expert who testified.** The Attorney General's expert witness, Scott Norwood, stated that Entergy *"has not demonstrated that the cost of the [Jefferson Power Station] is reasonable or that the project is the best available resource for meeting EAL's system capacity need in 2030."* APSC General Staff expert Jeffrey Bower recommended denial, citing cost uncertainty and inadequate ratepayer protections. The Southern Renewable Energy Association's Simon Mahan argued the project failed Act 373's own standard of being "reasonable, necessary, and in the public interest." Arkansas Electric Energy Consumers' expert Elizabeth Stanton noted the absence of competitive procurement.

The key to understanding why the PSC approved despite these findings lies in **Act 373's iterative resubmission mechanism** (detailed in Section 3 below). Under § 23-3-207(b)(3)(D), the denial-and-resubmission process *"may continue until"* the PSC approves, the utility withdraws, or the utility appeals—there is no provision for a final denial. Combined with the auto-approval clause (§ 23-4-1304(e)(2)(H)), which makes filings effective by operation of law if the PSC misses statutory deadlines, the Commission likely concluded that denial would merely delay, not prevent, the project.

The rate impact was estimated at approximately **$2.85 per month** for residential customers through the Strategic Investment Rider. Twenty-one state legislators (16 Republican, 5 Democrat), the Little Rock Regional Chamber, and the Arkansas State Chamber supported the application.

## 2. League of Women Voters v. Jester: The Ballot Initiative Firewall

Case No. 25-3389 in the 8th Circuit challenges Arkansas laws restricting the citizen ballot initiative process—the mechanism through which voters could potentially repeal or modify Acts 373 and 548. The case's relevance to infrastructure consolidation is that **it tests whether the democratic check on legislative action remains functional.**

### Status as of February 2026

The 8th Circuit appeal **remains pending**. No oral argument date has been scheduled or publicly announced. The merits briefing schedule is not publicly available. The district court preliminary injunction remains in effect after the 8th Circuit denied the emergency stay on December 12, 2025. The district court stay motion ruling has not been publicly reported.

**The July 20, 2026 date is confirmed.** Democracy Docket lists "July 20, 2026: Trial scheduled" for the **district court** proceeding—not the 8th Circuit appeal. This is the scheduled trial on the merits. It may be affected by the pending appeal.

### Strategic Implication: The "Clock-Running" Operation

The state does not need to win the appeal—it only needs to maintain legal uncertainty through **July 3, 2026**, the deadline for ballot petition signature submission. Even with the injunction technically in effect, the active appeal creates operational friction: canvassers face uncertainty about which rules apply, organizations struggle to hire staff amid legal ambiguity, and the signature-gathering window narrows. The appeal functions less as a quest for legal vindication than as a procedural mechanism to run out the 2026 cycle clock.

## 3. Act 373's Statutory Architecture Strips the PSC of Meaningful Denial Power

**Arkansas Act 373 of 2025** (SB 307, the "Generating Arkansas Jobs Act of 2025") was signed into law with an emergency clause making it **effective immediately on March 20, 2025.** The 62-page act, codified at Ark. Code § 23-4-1301 et seq., was sponsored by **Senator Jonathan Dismang (R-Searcy)** and **Representative Les Eaves (R-Searcy)** with bipartisan co-sponsors.

### The Rider Mechanism

The statute does not use the exact phrase "Strategic Investment Rider" as a defined term, but creates a **"rider"** (§ 23-4-1303(8)) to recover **"strategic investments"** (§ 23-4-1303(10)). The exact definition:

> *"Rider" means a rate schedule approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission to recover one (1) or more strategic investments and the recovery costs that are not included in other rates or rate schedules approved by the Arkansas Public Service Commission.*

Strategic investments cover construction or purchase of utility infrastructure to support growth and economic development, maintain reliable service, support nuclear license extensions, and ensure adequate dispatchable generation. **Wind resources located in Arkansas are explicitly excluded** (§ 23-4-1303(10)(D)). The rider allows utilities to recover costs during construction rather than capitalizing interest until completion—a mechanism Dismang described as avoiding *"a significant jump in rates"* when plants come online.

### The Iterative Resubmission Process

This is the Act's most consequential mechanism. Found in **§ 23-3-207(b)(3)**, it works as follows: If the PSC denies a certificate of public convenience and necessity, the order must specify the basis for denial and identify any evidence deemed insufficient. The utility may then resubmit with additional evidence, and the PSC must rule within **30 days**. If denied again, the same process repeats. The exact statutory language:

> *(D) The process outlined in subdivisions (b)(3)(B) and (C) of this section may continue until the commission finds that: (i) The public utility's application complies with this subchapter; (ii) The public utility withdraws its application; or (iii) The public utility appeals the commission's decision under § 23-2-423.*

**There is no provision for a final, conclusive denial.** The same iterative loop appears for rider filings (§ 23-4-1304(e)(2)(F)-(G)), cooperative filings (§ 23-4-1306(e)(2)(F)-(G)), out-of-state facilities (§ 23-18-104(d)(3)(B)), special rate contracts (§ 23-4-1309(a)(4)(C)), and alternative financing (§ 23-4-1310(c)(2)(D)).

### The 6-Month Decision Timeline

Section 23-3-207(a) requires: *"the commission shall enter an order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity within six (6) months after the public utility submits an application."* The same timeline applies to out-of-state facilities (§ 23-18-104(d)(1)).

### Auto-Approval Default

**If the PSC fails to act within statutory deadlines, the filing becomes effective by operation of law** (§ 23-4-1304(e)(2)(H)). Other critical timelines: **90 days** for initial rider approval, **60 days** for annual updates, **10 days** for amended filings after denial.

### Rate Cap and Earnings Provisions

Annual rider updates cannot push rates above **10% below the national average** for all customer sectors (§ 23-4-1305(f)(1)(A)), with exceptions if the utility demonstrates rates will still attract economic development. Arkansas currently sits approximately **25% below** the national average, providing substantial headroom. If a utility's return on equity exceeds its authorized rate plus 0.5%, the utility need not provide customer credits as long as it has strategic investments under construction in an equal or greater amount (§ 23-4-1304(t)).

### Legislative History

SB 307 initially **failed** on the Senate floor on March 5, 2025, falling one vote short (17-11). Senator Dismang moved to expunge the vote, the bill was amended, and it passed March 12 (23-9) with the emergency clause adopted 27-1. The House passed it 77-13 on March 18. Sen. Reginald Murdock, a bipartisan co-sponsor, acknowledged the bill *"was pushed through too fast."* Sen. Jimmy Hickey opposed, noting that "strategic investments" was insufficiently defined and the rate cap left substantial room for increases.

## 4. Act 548 Creates a Bespoke Data Center Tax Incentive Framework

**Arkansas Act 548 of 2025** (HB 1444) was signed into law on **April 10, 2025**, with an effective date of approximately **October 1, 2025.** Sponsored by **Representative Aaron Pilkington (R-Knoxville)** with **Senator Dismang** as Senate co-sponsor, the act amends Ark. Code § 26-52-456 to create a two-tier data center tax exemption.

### The "Two or More Nonadjacent" Clause—Exact Text

The definition of "Qualified Large Data Center" at § 26-52-456(a)(7)(A) reads:

> *"Qualified large data center" means a facility, including any addition to or expansion of the facility, that: (A) Is developed, acquired, constructed, expanded, rehabilitated, renovated, repaired, or operated to house a group of networked computer servers in **two (2) or more nonadjacent physical locations** that are connected to each other by fiber and associated equipment required for operating a fiber transmission network between the location and upstream internet peering points for the qualified firm that owns or operates the facility and its affiliates.*

This language enables a single entity to aggregate investments across **separate, non-contiguous sites** statewide into a single "Qualified Large Data Center" for tax exemption purposes.

### Investment Thresholds

The act created two tiers:

- **Qualified Data Center**: Threshold reduced from **$500 million to $100 million**, within 5 years after construction commences. Requires aggregate annualized compensation of at least $1 million.
- **Qualified Large Data Center** (new category): **$2 billion** threshold within 10 years after construction commences. Requires aggregate annualized compensation of at least $3 million.

### Fiber Connectivity Provisions

Fiber infrastructure is woven throughout the statute. The definition requires locations be *"connected to each other by fiber and associated equipment required for operating a fiber transmission network."* Furthermore, data center equipment eligible for the sales tax exemption explicitly includes *"conduit, ducting, and fiber optic and copper cabling that may be located outside the qualified data center...that is directly related to connecting one (1) or more distributed qualified data center or qualified large data center locations"* (§ 26-52-456(a)(1)(G)). The fiber connecting sites is itself tax-exempt.

### Legislative Intent and the "Non-Adjacent" Provision

Pilkington stated he had **"a couple projects in mind"** when crafting the bill but denied knowledge of specific projects at the time. His broader rationale: *"There's a large car manufacturer in almost every southern state except Arkansas. The car manufacturing rush to the south, we completely missed out on. I don't want to miss out on this kind of rush again."* The act was part of the Arkansas Department of Commerce's **IMPACT legislative package** assembled by Secretary Hugh McDonald. The bill includes a cryptocurrency mining exclusion—facilities *"primarily engaged in adding transactions involving virtual currency to a distributed ledger"* are ineligible.

A notable fallback provision protects individual sites: if a Qualified Large Data Center fails to meet the $2 billion aggregate threshold, individual facilities that independently meet the $100 million Qualified Data Center requirements retain their exemption.

## 5. AVAIO's $25 Billion Investor Remains Deliberately Unidentified

Despite extensive searching across SEC EDGAR, state corporate filings, press releases, media coverage, podcasts, and corporate databases, **the identity of AVAIO Digital Partners' primary equity investor has not been publicly disclosed anywhere in five years of operation.** This deliberate anonymity is itself the most significant finding.

### What the Record Shows

AVAIO Capital was founded in 2016 as the private infrastructure investment arm of **AECOM** (NYSE: ACM) and completed its spin-out on January 28, 2019. AVAIO Digital Partners launched in February 2021 with a **$375 million equity commitment** from what the February 18, 2021 PRNewswire release described as *"a large investment manager with more than $25 billion of assets under management."* That commitment was later increased to **$750 million**. The entity is privately owned by **Mark McComiskey** (CEO), **Anthony (Tony) J. Gordon** (Partner), and **Kevin Murphy** (Partner).

**AVAIO has zero public SEC filings**—no Form D, no 13F, no other disclosures. No CFIUS filings or reviews are publicly documented. No state-level filings revealing LP structures were located. No pension fund, endowment, or institutional investor disclosure mentions AVAIO as a holding. The investor is consistently described as an "investment manager"—not a sovereign wealth fund, family office, or pension fund—suggesting an asset management firm managing third-party capital.

### Circumstantial Indicators Pointing Toward Gulf Sovereign Capital

While no confirmed link exists to any specific sovereign wealth fund, several circumstantial threads deserve forensic attention:

- **Anthony Gordon's background at Och-Ziff Capital Management** (now Sculptor Capital), which historically had significant capital from Middle Eastern sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities and settled DOJ corruption charges related to the Libyan sovereign fund in 2016.
- **Gordon's physical presence in Abu Dhabi** during a Trump diplomatic visit, documented on his LinkedIn profile, suggesting active business relationships in the UAE.
- **The "$25 billion AUM" descriptor** is consistent with a subsidiary allocation arm of a Gulf sovereign wealth fund or a major global infrastructure manager such as IFM Investors, Global Infrastructure Partners, or Macquarie Infrastructure.
- **The deliberate, sustained anonymity** across five years and $18 billion+ in announced projects is more characteristic of sovereign wealth fund investment practices than typical institutional investors.
- **The project scale**—$6 billion campuses in Arkansas and Mississippi, $3 billion in Virginia—requires capital depth consistent with sovereign or quasi-sovereign backing.

### The "Conduit" Thesis

In the private equity world, **anonymity is the data point.** If the investor were a U.S. pension fund like CalPERS, they would likely announce it—public pension funds typically disclose infrastructure holdings. The sustained anonymity strongly suggests either: (a) sovereign or foreign capital that requires a "domestic shield" structure for CFIUS or political reasons, or (b) a family office or private entity that contractually prohibits disclosure. The former is more consistent with the project scale and Gordon's documented Gulf relationships.

### Recommended Forensic Next Steps

The most productive paths to unmasking the investor identity include:
- Delaware Secretary of State filings for AVAIO entity Certificates of Limited Partnership
- **PitchBook and Preqin terminal access** (which may have the investor behind paywalls)
- Bloomberg Terminal profile (1702255D:US)
- FOIA requests to Treasury regarding CFIUS reviews
- Pulaski County and Rankin County property records revealing SPV structures
- UCC secured lending filings
- **Arkansas Economic Development Commission incentive applications** filed by AVAIO, which may require beneficial ownership disclosure

## Conclusion: A Closed Regulatory Loop by Design

The forensic picture emerging from these five research threads reveals an interlocking legislative and regulatory architecture:

**Act 373 creates a system where the PSC cannot permanently deny utility projects**—only delay them through an iterative loop that terminates exclusively in approval, withdrawal, or appeal. The PSC's January 2026 order approving the Jefferson Power Station despite finding its costs unreasonable is the predictable outcome of this statutory design, not an anomaly.

**Act 548 establishes a data center tax framework whose "nonadjacent" aggregation clause and $2 billion threshold appear tailored to accommodate specific project configurations** like AVAIO's multi-site Arkansas campus and Google's distributed footprint across West Memphis, Little Rock, and Conway.

**The primary capital behind AVAIO's $6-21 billion Arkansas campus remains shielded from public disclosure** through a corporate structure with no SEC reporting obligations and deliberate anonymity maintained across five years of operation.

**The one democratic mechanism that could allow Arkansas voters to challenge this framework—the ballot initiative process—is the subject of an active federal lawsuit** where the state lost at the district court level but the appeal creates operational uncertainty through the July 3, 2026 signature deadline. The district court trial is set for **July 20, 2026**—after the signature window closes.

Each element functions independently but reinforces the others, creating a closed loop between legislative authorization, constrained regulation, targeted incentives, undisclosed capital, and restricted citizen recourse. The structural evidence—a regulatory body approving what it found "not reasonable" because the law compelled it—is stronger than any individual quote. It documents capture not through rhetoric but through mechanism.
