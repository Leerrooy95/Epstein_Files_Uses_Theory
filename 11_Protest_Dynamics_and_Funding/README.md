# Protest Dynamics and Funding

## Scope

This folder contains analytical material examining **protest activity as a structural and financial phenomenon**, not as an attribution exercise against specific individuals or groups.

The current file, **Protests_Funding_Audit.txt**, is a **text-based audit and pattern analysis** of publicly observable protest dynamics, funding signals, and organizational behaviors using open-source reporting and prior repository frameworks.

## Methodology

- Public-source only (news reporting, public statements, historical patterns)
- No private or personally identifiable information (PII)
- No attribution of intent or coordination beyond what is directly observable
- Temporal and structural correlations are noted as **analytical signals**, not proof of causation

The analysis focuses on **system-level mechanics** such as:
- Funding pathways and logistical sustainability
- Event timing and escalation patterns
- Reuse of protest infrastructure across cycles
- Alignment with broader political or regulatory environments

## Limitations

- This material does **not** claim centralized control, illegal activity, or covert coordination.
- Observed alignments are contextual and probabilistic.
- The analysis is exploratory and may be expanded or revised as additional data becomes available.

## Status

- Current contents: 1 analytical text file  
- Future additions may include structured datasets, timelines, or visualizations, if warranted by evidence
