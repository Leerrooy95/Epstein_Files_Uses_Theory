## Media Cycle Density

**Shedule:**

*Daily at 9:50 am*

**Instruction:**

Detect "flashbang" media saturation patterns.

Count Major unrelated news stories dominated headlines today. Flag if there are 3+ major stories competing for attention simultaneously.

Cross-Reference with thermostat predictions: When an institutional compliance event should occur (based on 14-day lag from friction), check if that day has unusally HIGH media noise about unrelated topics.

Examples of flashbang stories:

Breaking international incidents

Celebrity Scandals

Natural disasters

Political controversies unrelated to institutional accountability

Multiple "breaking news" alerts within 6-hour windows

Pattern to detect: Does media saturation increase during predicted compliance windows? Are anchor events (major deals, policy shifts) announced during maximum noise?

ONly report if media density is notably high AND correlates with predicted compliance timing.
