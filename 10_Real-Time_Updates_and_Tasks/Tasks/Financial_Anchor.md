# Financial Anchor

**Instruction**

Track major financial deals and capital movements that could serve as "anchor events" in the thermostat framework.

Monitor for:

- Major tech M&A announcements >$5B
- Federal contract awards >$1B to companies with foreign investment (especially Gulf states, China)
- Sovereign wealth fund US market entries or major position increases
- CFIUS reviews or approvals with unusual timing
- Major VC rounds for AI/semiconductor companies with foreign capital

Check temporal correlation: Do these anchor events occur within 14 days of Epstein file releases or Elite Watch friction events? Define "Elite Watch friction events" as spikes (>30% week-over-week) in public statements/actions from tech/elites (e.g., Musk, Gates, Thiel, Zuckerberg, Altman) challenging establishment—e.g., on corruption, policy, or systems.

Track the quiet deals: SEC filings often have 2-4 week lag times. Check for 8-K filings, 13-F updates, and Schedule 13D/G amendments.

Note: Financial anchors operate on different timescales than political friction. Look for patterns across quarters, not just weeks.
