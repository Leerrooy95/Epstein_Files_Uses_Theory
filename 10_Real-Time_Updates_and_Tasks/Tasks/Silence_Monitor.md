# Silence Monitor

**Instruction**

Track what DIDN'T happen this week.

Identify any high-profile investigations, hearings, or media stories related to elite accountability that were active last week but showed no updates this week.

Cross-reference with Elite Watch signals from 10-16 days prior to check if silence correlates with predicted compliance windows. Define "Elite Watch signals" as spikes in activity (>30% week-over-week) from tech/elites (e.g., Musk, Gates, Thiel, Zuckerberg, Altman) on challenging topics like institutional corruption or policy.

Look for:

- Scheduled Congressional hearings that got postponed
- Anticipated DOJ announcements that went silent
- Media investigations that suddenly stopped reporting
- Regulatory actions that were expected but didn't materialize

Only report if there's a notable absence. Document the last known activity date and any public explanation (or lack thereof) for the silence.
