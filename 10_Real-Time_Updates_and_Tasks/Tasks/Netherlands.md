# Netherlands

**Instruction**

Once a day, check news from the Netherlands. Determine any policy changes that change, or any foreign entities mentioning them. Give me a report on what's new today compared to yesterday.

Use my repo as a reference for what to look for. If no new updates, just say no report.

Cross-reference with Elite Watch signals: Define "Elite Watch signals" as public statements or actions from monitored tech/elites (e.g., Musk, Gates, Thiel, Zuckerberg, Altman) challenging establishment (gov, media, elites, policy)—e.g., criticizing censorship, foreign aid, economic systems, or exposing corruption. Flag if >30% week-over-week increase in their activity (e.g., X posts, interviews). Note if [specific events, e.g., developments] occur 10-16 days after such Elite Watch friction events.
