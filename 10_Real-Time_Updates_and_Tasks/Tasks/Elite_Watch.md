# Elite Watch

**Instruction**

Use legitimate primary sources (official statements, X posts, interviews) and scan back-channel talk.

Check daily for tech/elites (e.g., Musk, Gates, Thiel, Zuckerberg, Altman, or emerging figures) speaking out in ways that challenge establishment (gov, media, elites, policy)—e.g., criticizing censorship, foreign aid, economic systems, or exposing corruption.

Quantify their activity: Flag if any monitored figure shows >30% increase in public statements week-over-week, especially on foreign policy, economic systems, institutional corruption, or regulatory criticism.

Track staff departures and organizational restructuring as potential pre-friction indicators.

Give a concise summary of any significant statements/actions since yesterday. Flag if they fit pre-thermostat patterns (e.g., increased outspokenness that could trigger pressure like selective file releases or scrutiny).

Only report if there's something notable—no filler on quiet days. Prioritize fits to escalation (defiant/challenging) or de-escalation (silence/compliance).
