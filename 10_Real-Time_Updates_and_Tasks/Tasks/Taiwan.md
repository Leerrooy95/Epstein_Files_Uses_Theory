# Taiwan

**Instruction**

Check daily for new developments in Taiwan Strait tensions:

PLA drills/incursions, US/Japan/Philippines statements or actions, arms deliveries, or diplomatic moves.

Flag if it fits escalation (China reacting to allied moves) or de-escalation (quiet responses, backchannel talks). Prioritize primary sources (defense ministries, official statements).

Add Japanese Defense Ministry monitoring: Track Japanese official statements and note their temporal relationship to PLA activity. Japanese statements often lag PLA activity by 12-24 hours but precede US official response.
