# Epstein_Files_Uses_Theory: The Geopolitical Utility Model

## Overview
This repository provides a data-driven investigation into the **Geopolitical Utility** of the Jeffrey Epstein investigative files. Rather than focusing on sensationalism, this project uses data science to analyze how the timing of "unsealing" events correlates with major shifts in AI infrastructure, social media ownership, and corporate liquidation.

## The Theory: "Reflexive Control"
The core hypothesis is that the Epstein files function as a **geopolitical thermostat**. 

*Updated*:

## The Theory: "Reflexive Control" & "Unwitting Assets"
* **The Geopolitical Thermostat:** Information leaks are timed to regulate the behavior of tech giants.
* **The Unwitting Asset Model:** The network functioned as a "Crisis-Rescue" mechanism. Foreign actors (Russia, then Saudi Arabia) provided "Rescue Capital" to leveraged US elites, turning them into unwitting proxies for technology transfer and sanctions evasion.



* **Lever (Friction):** Redacted files are released or leaked to create pressure on specific entities (e.g., tech CEOs or political rivals).
* **Anchor (Reward):** Once the target entity aligns with specific sovereign goals (e.g., selling a platform like TikTok or migrating data to a "Trusted Partner" like Oracle), the pressure is lowered.

## Key Finding: The September-December 2025 Loop
Our analysis identified a 90-day cycle where:
1. **Sept 2025:** Select leaks link high-profile tech leaders to the files (The "Friction").
2. **Nov 2025:** The "Epstein Files Transparency Act" passes with near-unanimous support (427-1).
3. **Dec 2025:** The final $14B TikTok-Oracle deal is signed exactly 24 hours before the DOJ releases a massive, yet heavily redacted, trove of 13,000 documents (The "Resolution").

## Repository Structure
* `/01_Levers_and_Frictions`: Timelines of subpoenas and document releases.
* `/02_Anchors_and_Financials`: Banking risk (AML) and entity-specific sentiment analysis.
* `/03_Master_Framework`: The core Reflexive Control datasets.
* `/04_Testing_and_Counters`: Backtests comparing these events to historical patterns.
