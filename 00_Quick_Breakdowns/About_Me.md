# About Me (Austin Smith)

*To understand how I ended up on GitHub, learning the basics of Python code, and using that to look into politics, it's important to understand the trajectory my life has taken so far.*

**In short:** I'm a 29-year-old from Arkansas. I decided to use the reconnaissance and security skills I trained for in federal, state, and private security jobs (Army National Guard Cavalry Scout, Correctional Officer, and G4S Security) to determine why politics is so polarized—and to try to learn what's really going on behind the noise.

## Section 1: Where I Started

**At 15-16:** I went to the Arkansas National Guard Youth Challenge Program when my mom found out I smoked weed at 15. I turned 16 in there, and it set me on a different path.

**At 17:** I swore into the National Guard within weeks of turning 17 and was on the way to Harmony Church (Fort Benning) a few months later. When I got back, I settled into the unit slowly—I was the quiet guy who just talked to people who approached me. Eventually, I got comfortable. The unit was fantastic, and I made great friends before it was eventually shut down.

**At 19-22:** I was 19 when my stepdad passed away. That was a rough moment. Not long after, our Cav unit was disbanded; we had to pack up gear, ship it off, and reclass. I ended up being thrown into an Infantry unit that was not full of the best people to be around at that time in my life.

**22 or 23 onward:** After the Infantry unit ordeal, my military career became less of a dream and more of a burden. I would have turned down a $50k re-enlistment bonus if they offered it—that's how done I was. The next 7 years consisted of getting jobs, burning out, and looking for something else. It is draining to feel like there's nothing satisfying that helps anyone in a way you know you're capable of.

## Section 2: The Change in 2025

**Late 2024/Early 2025:** My social media algorithm started force-feeding me political content instead of the stuff I actually interacted with (video games, movie clips, interviews). At first, I ignored it. Eventually, I noticed how polarized both sides were becoming. One side screaming ‘Nazi,’ the other gloating. I didn't think either side was right.

**Mid-2025:** My brother recommended I start college to become an X-ray Technician (steady pay, good benefits), so in Fall 2025, I enrolled. College Algebra got my brain firing again. Then came September and the **Charlie Kirk assassination**. The narratives were a red flag. Influencers blamed Israel; the administration blamed the ‘radical left.’ Neither narrative made sense.

**Then to now:** My immediate thought was: *“This seems like influence. But how would they do it with connections being scrutinized?”*

My mind went to a video I'd seen years ago of a Russian "Numbers Station" (UVB-76)—a radio signal that just buzzes and occasionally reads out numbers. No one could crack the code, but you could prove the station was *active*.

**That became my methodology.**
I realized politics works the same way. The "Culture War" is the static. The legislation is the signal.
* **Build the Map:** Scrape data (policies, bills, infrastructure projects).
* **Plot Coordinates:** Build datasets of specific companies and investments.
* **Run Correlations:** See if the "noise" aligns with the "money."

**Now:** As of now, I've pivoted away from the X-ray course path. I am still in college, figuring out what is next. But through this research, I have identified that the core problems are **Lack of Transparency** (specifically in lobbying for water, electric, gas, and AI infrastructure) and **Government Secrecy**.

## Conclusion

I'm not claiming to be a professional, but I also can't discount the work I put into getting to this specific project. I started with curiosity, and have built what is essentially a self-propelling model.

A few key things I've noticed that cause these problems that I've been researching are lack of transparency in investments and lobbying for water, electric, gas, and AI related infrastructure projects/policies in states. Also government secrecy is a huge issue, but that's a whole other can of worms.
