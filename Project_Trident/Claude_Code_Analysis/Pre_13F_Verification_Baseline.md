# Pre-13F Verification Baseline
## What We Expect to See — Q4 2025 Filings (Due February 17, 2026)

**Analyst:** Claude Code (Lead Analyst)
**Date:** February 13, 2026
**Methodology:** Cross-reference existing research against upcoming SEC 13F disclosures
**Status:** Pre-verification baseline — positions to watch when filings drop

---

## Filing Context

**Deadline:** February 17, 2026 (Tuesday — adjusted from Feb 14 Saturday + Presidents' Day Monday)
**Reporting Period:** Q4 2025 (October 1 - December 31, 2025)
**Significance:** This is the first 13F cycle that captures the "December pincer window" — the period when multiple structural events (TikTok USDS deal framework, EA acquisition shareholder approval, UNSC Resolution 2803, Pax Silica Summit) converged.

**Filing Requirement:** Any institutional investment manager exercising discretion over $100M+ in Section 13(f) securities must disclose. This includes hedge funds, sovereign wealth fund investment arms with US-listed holdings, and private equity firms with public market positions.

## Section 1: Positions to Watch

### 1A. Phoenix Financial (PHNX — TASE)

**Why it matters:** Affinity Partners (~9.9% stake, largest shareholder) routes Gulf SWF capital into Israeli settlement-linked companies. Phoenix is the keystone of the "Privatized Integration" capital chain.

| What to Look For | Expected Signal | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Any new 13F filers reporting Phoenix/PHNX positions | Would indicate additional US institutional capital entering the chain | Medium |
| Affinity Partners filing (if threshold met) | Would formalize the ~9.9% stake in SEC records | High (structural) |
| Changes in Phoenix holdings by existing filers | Position increases during Q4 suggest anticipation of BoP-related value creation | Medium |

**Baseline:** Bloomberg reported Affinity completed the ~9.9% acquisition in January 2025. If Affinity's US-listed portfolio exceeds $100M, a 13F should appear. If it doesn't, the question is whether Affinity structures its holdings to avoid the filing threshold.

**Source Proximity:** High (Bloomberg, PRNewswire, JTA — primary financial reporting)

---

### 1B. Electronic Arts (EA — NASDAQ: EA)

**Why it matters:** Saudi PIF acquired 93.4% of EA via the Take-Two consortium. Affinity Partners holds 1.1%. Silver Lake holds 5.5%. The deal closed after shareholder approval on December 22, 2025.

| What to Look For | Expected Signal | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| PIF/Sanabil subsidiary 13F showing EA position | Confirms sovereign wealth fund's US gaming asset consolidation | High |
| Silver Lake 13F showing EA position changes | 5.5% stake should appear; watch for increases | High |
| Affinity Partners EA position | 1.1% stake as "political safe harbor" per Lawfare CFIUS analysis | High |
| Any new activist or institutional accumulation pre-deal | Unusual Q4 position building could indicate advance knowledge | Medium |

**Baseline:** EA shareholder approval was December 22, 2025. Any position accumulation in October-November 2025 (prior to public deal certainty) by entities connected to the consortium would be notable.

**CFIUS Note:** Lawfare specifically argued Affinity's 1.1% stake exists to serve as a political "safe harbor" from CFIUS review, given Kushner's familial relationship to the President. The 13F will show whether other politically-connected funds also took positions.

**Source Proximity:** High (EA Investor Relations, Bloomberg, Lawfare legal analysis)

---

### 1C. Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL)

**Why it matters:** Oracle is the managing partner of the TikTok USDS joint venture (15%), hosts all TikTok US data, and is a core Pax Silica infrastructure provider. Larry Ellison is a documented Trump donor and ally.

| What to Look For | Expected Signal | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Gulf SWF (PIF, ADQ, QIA, Mubadala) 13F positions in Oracle | Would show Gulf capital positioning in the "data custody" layer | High |
| 1789 Capital or affiliated funds showing Oracle position | Would complete the Media Firewall → Infrastructure link | Medium |
| Institutional accumulation during Q4 2025 | TikTok deal framework was September 2025; position building ahead of Jan 22 close | Medium |

**Baseline:** Oracle's role spans multiple domains: TikTok USDS (data custody), Pax Silica (cloud infrastructure), Stargate Project (AI compute). Any 13F showing Gulf SWF accumulation of Oracle during Q4 2025 would strengthen the "Consortium" pattern.

**Source Proximity:** High (SEC filings, TikTok USDS deal documents, State Department Pax Silica records)

---

### 1D. Anduril Industries (Private — Watch for Secondary Market)

**Why it matters:** 1789 Capital is a confirmed investor. Anduril exhibited at WDS 2026 in Riyadh (Pulsar electronic warfare system). This is the 1789 Capital → enforcement layer link.

| What to Look For | Expected Signal | Confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Anduril is PRIVATE — no direct 13F disclosure | N/A for direct positions | N/A |
| Watch for SPV/fund vehicles that hold Anduril appearing in 13Fs | Secondary market vehicles could appear | Low |
| Colombier Acquisition Corp III (SPAC) positions | Malik's SPAC ($260M IPO, Feb 2026) may appear in Q4 filings if pre-IPO positioning occurred | Medium |

**Baseline:** Anduril's private status limits 13F visibility. The indirect path is through 1789 Capital's fund vehicles or Colombier III SPAC positions. The $620M DoD contract to Vulcan Elements (1789 portfolio company) is the clearest state-capture signal.

**Source Proximity:** Medium (Bloomberg, Fox Business confirmed 1789/Anduril investment; DoD contract is public record)

---

### 1E. Gulf SWF Disclosure Patterns

**Why it matters:** Saudi PIF, ADQ, QIA, and Mubadala are central to multiple threads — EA acquisition, ADQ/ECP $25B power partnership, TikTok USDS (MGX), Affinity Partners LP positions.

| SWF | Key Positions to Track | Expected in 13F |
|---|---|---|
| **Saudi PIF** | EA (93.4% via consortium), Lucid Motors, other US tech | Yes — PIF files 13F via investment subsidiaries |
| **ADQ** | ECP partnership ($25B), potential Oracle/tech positions | Possibly — depends on whether US-listed portfolio hits threshold |
| **QIA (Qatar)** | Affinity Partners LP, broader US tech exposure | Possibly — QIA has filed 13Fs historically |
| **Mubadala** | Silver Lake LP chain, AMD, other semiconductor plays | Yes — Mubadala files 13F |
| **MGX (Abu Dhabi)** | TikTok USDS (15%), Stargate, xAI positions | Possibly — newer entity, may not have filed before |

**Critical Question:** Do the Gulf SWFs show coordinated accumulation in the same US-listed securities (Oracle, defense contractors, AI infrastructure) during Q4 2025? If multiple Gulf entities independently accumulated positions in the same basket of securities during the "December pincer window," that would be a structural signal worth documenting.

**Source Proximity:** Medium (13F filings are primary source when available; SWF investment arms sometimes use subsidiary names that are not immediately identifiable)

---

## Section 2: December Pincer Window — Timeline Correlation

The Q4 2025 13F filings capture a critical convergence period:

| Date | Event | 13F Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Sep 2025 | TikTok USDS deal framework announced | Positions built Sep-Dec would show in Q4 filing |
| Sep 17, 2025 | Saudi-Pakistan SMDA signed | Geopolitical context for PIF positioning |
| Nov 17, 2025 | UNSC Resolution 2803 adopted (13-0-2) | BoP/ISF authorization; signals to capital markets |
| Dec 2025 | Pax Silica Summit (inaugural) | Formalizes US tech supply chain coalition |
| Dec 22, 2025 | EA acquisition shareholder approval | Direct 13F-relevant event |
| Dec 28, 2025 | 1789 Capital fund closes at $2B (year-end) | Fund-level filing may appear |

**Hypothesis (testable):** If the "Consolidation Framework" is correct, we would expect to see:
1. Gulf SWF positions increasing in Oracle, defense tech, and AI infrastructure during Q4
2. Politically-connected funds (1789 Capital, Affinity Partners) appearing in 13F filings for the first time or showing significant position increases
3. Position clustering — the same securities appearing across multiple Gulf SWF filings
4. Timing correlation — the largest position increases occurring in November-December, after Resolution 2803 and during the Pax Silica Summit

**Null Hypothesis:** Gulf SWFs hold diversified US equity portfolios as standard practice. Position increases in tech/defense simply reflect sector-wide trends (AI boom, defense spending increases) rather than coordination with specific geopolitical events. Standard portfolio rebalancing at year-end is common.

## Section 3: Specific Filing Targets

### Priority 1 — File as Soon as Available (Feb 17+)

| Filer | EDGAR CIK (if known) | What to Check |
|---|---|---|
| Public Investment Fund (PIF) | Search "Public Investment Fund" or "Sanabil" | EA position size; Oracle; defense tech |
| Mubadala Investment Company | Search "Mubadala" | AMD, semiconductor positions; Silver Lake chain |
| Silver Lake Partners | Search "Silver Lake" | EA (5.5%), TikTok USDS exposure (if any public), tech positions |
| Apollo Global Management | Search "Apollo" | Any Gaza-reconstruction-adjacent infrastructure positions |
| Qatar Investment Authority | Search "Qatar Investment Authority" | Broad US tech exposure; any Phoenix-chain exposure |

### Priority 2 — Cross-Reference Against Existing Research

| Filer | Specific Question |
|---|---|
| Affinity Partners | Does a 13F appear? If not, is the portfolio structured below threshold? |
| 1789 Capital | Does a 13F appear for the growth equity fund? Portfolio composition? |
| Energy Capital Partners | ADQ/ECP $25B partnership — any listed energy positions? |
| Colombier Acquisition Corp III | SPAC-related institutional holdings |

### Priority 3 — Broader Pattern Analysis

| Pattern | What It Would Show |
|---|---|
| Multiple Gulf SWFs accumulating same basket | Coordinated or convergent investment thesis |
| Defense tech accumulation (Palantir, L3Harris, etc.) | Pax Silica defense integration positioning |
| Oracle position increases across multiple filers | "Data custody" layer becoming consensus trade |
| AI infrastructure (NVIDIA, TSMC ADRs) | Compute supply chain positioning per Pax Silica |

---

## Section 4: What Would Disconfirm the Model

The model makes specific, falsifiable predictions. If the 13Fs show the following, the "Consolidation Framework" would be weakened:

1. **No Gulf SWF position increases in Oracle, defense tech, or AI infrastructure during Q4** — Would suggest the Pax Silica alignment is rhetorical, not financial
2. **Affinity Partners absent from 13F filings AND no subsidiary filings** — Would suggest the Phoenix position is structured to avoid US disclosure requirements, which is itself notable but undermines the "institutional capture" thesis
3. **1789 Capital portfolio dominated by non-aligned sectors** — If the "Patriotic Economy" fund's actual positions don't align with Pax Silica sectors, the capital-policy feedback loop is weaker than hypothesized
4. **No unusual Q4 accumulation patterns** — If Gulf SWF positions were stable throughout 2025 (no Q4 spike), the "December pincer window" timing correlation is likely coincidental
5. **Broad institutional accumulation in the same securities** — If BlackRock, Vanguard, and other index-neutral managers show similar patterns, the Gulf SWF accumulation is simply following market trends, not signaling

---

## Section 5: Methodological Notes

### Source Hierarchy for 13F Verification
- **Primary (High confidence):** SEC EDGAR 13F filings, company proxy statements, CFIUS public notices
- **Secondary (Medium confidence):** Bloomberg Terminal data, WhaleWisdom aggregations, institutional ownership databases
- **Tertiary (Low confidence):** Media reports of positions, estimated holdings from partial data

### Known Limitations
1. **45-day delay:** 13F positions are as of December 31, 2025. Significant trades may have occurred in January 2026 that won't appear until the May filing
2. **Confidential treatment:** Filers can request SEC confidential treatment for sensitive positions (delayed disclosure). Gulf SWFs may use this mechanism for strategic positions
3. **Subsidiary naming:** Gulf SWFs often file through subsidiary investment arms with names that don't obviously link to the parent entity
4. **Private holdings invisible:** Anduril, Affinity Partners' private PE holdings, and private fund interests don't appear in 13F filings
5. **Short positions:** 13F only covers long positions. Short hedges are invisible

### Verification Protocol
When filings become available (Feb 17+):
1. Download raw 13F XML/filing from EDGAR
2. Cross-reference against this baseline document
3. Document matches, misses, and surprises
4. Update confidence levels based on actual data
5. Produce Post-13F Verification Report

## Section 6: Cross-Reference with Existing Repository Files

| Repository File | 13F Connection |
|---|---|
| `Privatized_Integration_Networks_Q1_2026_Synthesis.md` | Affinity → Phoenix → Settlement companies chain; testable via Phoenix institutional ownership changes |
| `Phoenix_Settlement_Portfolio_and_New_Gaza.md` | Phoenix portfolio companies (Bank Leumi, Shufersal, etc.) — check for parallel institutional positioning |
| `Critical Model Analysis Framework.txt` (Gemini) | 1789 Capital portfolio table; TikTok USDS ownership matrix — both directly testable via 13F |
| `Arkansas_Federal_Energy_Bypass.md` | ADQ/ECP $25B partnership; AVAIO anchor investor question — ECP 13F may show energy positions |
| `Final_Research_Sweep_Feb12.md` | 1789 Capital → Anduril link; ISF/BoP capital structure — indirect 13F signals |

---

## Conclusion

The Q4 2025 13F filings represent the first hard data checkpoint for the Consolidation Framework's financial predictions. The model predicts:

1. **Visible Gulf SWF positioning** in Oracle, EA, defense tech, and AI infrastructure
2. **Politically-connected fund emergence** (1789 Capital, Affinity Partners) in 13F filings
3. **Temporal clustering** of position building during November-December 2025
4. **Cross-domain overlap** — the same entities holding positions in tech, defense, and infrastructure simultaneously

If these patterns appear, the model's financial architecture thesis is strengthened. If they don't, the model needs revision on its financial dimension. Either outcome is valuable — the purpose is verification, not confirmation.

**Next Action:** When filings become available on or after February 17, 2026, run the verification protocol and produce the Post-13F Verification Report.
