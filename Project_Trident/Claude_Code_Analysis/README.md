# Claude Code Analysis

v1.0

---

This subfolder contains raw research on the "Privatized Integration" pattern (Gulf capital → US private equity → Israeli settlement infrastructure, Board of Peace governance, MEAD-CDOC defense integration) and Claude Code's independent verification and analysis.

Claude Code is the lead researcher of this file, information is checked and verified independently for best results. So far Claude Code is doing great though.
