## Executive Summary

This document tracks three parallel channels through which US-Israel-Saudi integration is proceeding despite the formal stalling of diplomatic normalization on Palestinian statehood conditions:

1. **The Affinity Channel** — Private equity corridor routing Saudi sovereign capital into Israeli financial infrastructure
2. **The Board of Peace** — Pay-to-play governance structure placing Israeli business interests alongside Gulf and Turkish officials
3. **Defense Integration Infrastructure** — CENTCOM-managed frameworks enabling potential Israeli participation in regional air defense without formal treaties

The pattern: **Public diplomacy stalls while private capital, governance roles, and military infrastructure converge.**

---

## 1. The Affinity Channel: Saudi Capital → Israeli Financial Infrastructure

### Overview

Affinity Partners, founded by Jared Kushner in 2021 and backed by Saudi PIF ($2B initial investment), has become the largest shareholder in Phoenix Financial Ltd., one of Israel's leading insurance and asset management companies.

### Timeline

| Date | Event | Source |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2021 | Affinity Partners founded; receives $2B from Saudi PIF | Bloomberg, Senate investigation |
| July 2024 | Affinity acquires initial 4.95% stake in Phoenix Financial ($128.5M) | Bloomberg |
| Jan 15, 2025 | Israeli regulators approve Affinity doubling stake to ~9.9% | Bloomberg, JTA |
| Jan 20, 2025 | Transaction completed; Affinity becomes Phoenix's largest shareholder | PRNewswire |
| March 2025 | Middle East Eye investigation reveals Phoenix holdings in UN-listed settlement companies | Business & Human Rights Centre |

### Phoenix Financial Profile

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| Founded | 1949 (shortly after Israel's establishment) |
| Assets Under Management | ₪500 billion (~$137 billion) |
| Market Cap | ₪14.7 billion (~$4 billion) |
| Stock Performance | +50% since Kushner's initial investment |
| Current CEO | Eyal Ben Simon |
| Affinity Stake | ~9.9% (largest shareholder) |

### Settlement Connection

According to the March 2025 Middle East Eye investigation:

- Phoenix holds shares in 11 public companies and 1 private company listed in the UN OHCHR database of businesses operating in illegal Israeli settlements
- Settlements span the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and occupied Syrian Golan Heights
- Phoenix owns 80% stake in a large shopping mall in an East Jerusalem settlement

**Affinity's Response**: "Affinity is proud to be the largest shareholder of Phoenix, one of the best performing and well regarded Israeli financial institutions."

### The Capital Flow Structure

```
Saudi PIF ($2B)
      ↓
Affinity Partners (Miami)
      ↓
Phoenix Financial (Tel Aviv)
      ↓
Settlement-linked companies (West Bank, Golan)
```

**Significance**: Saudi sovereign capital now flows into Israeli financial infrastructure—and by extension into settlement construction—through a US-based private equity intermediary, bypassing formal diplomatic normalization requirements.

### Additional Affinity Israeli Holdings

- **Shlomo Holdings**: 15% stake ($110M, acquired 2024) — Schmelzer family holding company

## 2. The Board of Peace: Governance Integration

### Structure Overview

The Board of Peace, announced January 2026, creates a three-tiered governance structure for Gaza that places Israeli business interests alongside Gulf, Turkish, and Qatari officials.

| Billionaire Financier | Marc Rowan (Apollo Global) |

**Membership Terms**:

### Yakir Gabay Profile

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| Nationality | Israeli-Cypriot-British |
| Net Worth | Billionaire (€30B real estate empire) |
| Primary Asset | 15% of Aroundtown (Frankfurt-listed, €4.1B market cap) |

**Key Relationships**:
- Co-chairs Israeli-American Council (IAC) New York gala with Miriam Adelson
- Worked with Kushner and Witkoff on Gaza reconstruction plan since late 2023
- "Not there under the title 'Israeli,' but as an international adviser" — per associates

**Gabay's Reconstruction Vision**:
- Security-first approach: Hamas disarmament prerequisite to economic development
- Egypt as "most dominant factor"
- Expects "catastrophic success" (Kushner's phrase)
- Believes Turkey/Qatar inclusion prevents UN veto

**Source Quotes**:

> "Investing in Phoenix in July 2024 was a decision rooted in my belief in Israel's resiliency." — Jared Kushner

> "On this board, Gabay is not there under the title 'Israeli,' but as someone with capabilities and for whom the issue matters." — Associate

> "If we solve Gaza, then we'll solve that too [West Bank]. Because in Judea and Samaria, the difference is the mixing of populations. Gaza… Israel doesn't want Gaza." — Gabay at WEF

### Israel's Official Response

Netanyahu's office stated the Gaza Executive Board "was not coordinated with Israel and is contrary to its policy" — rare public criticism of the Trump administration.

**Analysis**: The objection appears tactical rather than substantive. As one analyst noted: "Netanyahu's objection is tactical. Ultimately, this board outsources the heavy lifting of managing Gaza's misery to international donors, while Israel retains security control without paying the price."

### Countries Accepting Board of Peace Membership

**Confirmed Members** (as of Feb 2026):
Albania, Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel (via Gabay), Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, Uzbekistan, Vietnam

**Notable**: Russia invited; Putin consulting with "strategic partners" before deciding

## 3. Defense Integration Infrastructure

### MEAD-CDOC: The Integration Framework

**Established**: January 12, 2026  
**Location**: Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar (within Combined Air Operations Center)  
**Function**: Middle Eastern Air Defense – Combined Defense Operations Cell

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Participating Nations | 17 nations in CAOC framework |
| Purpose | Coordinate air and missile defense across Middle East |
| Activities | Planning multinational exercises, conducting drills, responding to contingencies |
| Commander Quote | "This cell will improve how regional forces coordinate and share air and missile defense responsibilities across the Middle East" — Adm. Brad Cooper, CENTCOM |

**Significance**: MEAD-CDOC creates a *mechanism* for potential Israeli integration into regional air defense without requiring formal bilateral treaties with Gulf states. Israeli assets could theoretically participate under US CENTCOM auspices.

### Red Sands Exercise Series

**Red Sands 2025** (September 7-14/16, 2025):
- Largest live-fire counter-drone exercise in Middle East history
- Location: Shamal-2 Range, northeastern Saudi Arabia
- Participants: 300+ personnel, 20 counter-UAS systems
- Focus: Detection, tracking, elimination of drone threats
- Leadership: Adm. Brad Cooper (CENTCOM), Gen. Fayyadh Al-Ruwaili (Saudi Armed Forces)

**Systems Tested**:
- Signal Hunter (body-worn RF geolocation)
- Buffer Passive Acoustic Detection System
- Vanguard (drone swarm elimination)
- Drone Defeat Rounds (720 tungsten pellets)

**Expansion Trajectory**:
- 2023: Red Sands established
- 2024: Expanded capabilities
- 2025: Largest iteration; focus on integrated kill chains and swarm defense
- 2026+: Defense officials confirm potential expansion to include Bahrain, UAE, Jordan, Kuwait

### Bilateral Command Posts (2025)

CENTCOM established bilateral Combined Command Posts for air and missile defense with:
- Qatar
- Bahrain

These serve as "hubs for integrated air defense planning, coordination, and operations."

### Integration Pathway Analysis

The infrastructure now exists for Israeli participation in regional air defense through:

1. **CAOC Framework**: 17-nation coalition already coordinating air assets
2. **MEAD-CDOC**: Dedicated cell for multinational air defense coordination
3. **Bilateral Command Posts**: Qatar and Bahrain hubs operational
4. **Red Sands Exercises**: Annual venue for testing integrated systems

**What Would Be Required**:
- No formal Saudi-Israel treaty necessary
- Israeli liaison officers could participate under US CENTCOM umbrella
- Shared threat data (Iranian drones/missiles) provides operational rationale
- Abraham Accords partners (UAE, Bahrain) already in framework

## 4. The EA Acquisition: Consortium Convergence

### Transaction Overview

### Consortium Composition

| Entity | Role | Stake |
|--------|------|-------|

- DOJ Epstein file release (Dec 19)
- VOCA funding freeze (Dec 22)
- DJI drone ban
- TeraWulf AI pivot

## 5. Synthesized Pattern: Privatized Normalization

### What the Evidence Shows

| Channel | Mechanism | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Financial** | Affinity Partners | Saudi PIF → US PE → Israeli financial infrastructure |
| **Governance** | Board of Peace | Israeli billionaire on Gaza board alongside Gulf/Turkish officials |
| **Security** | MEAD-CDOC/Red Sands | Framework exists for Israeli integration under CENTCOM |
| **Tech/Data** | EA Consortium | Same actors (PIF, Affinity) consolidating gaming/behavioral data |

### The Bifurcation

**Public Track**: 
- Saudi normalization "conditional on Palestinian statehood"
- Netanyahu objects to Gaza Executive Board composition
- No formal Saudi-Israel treaty

**Private Track**:
- Saudi capital flows into Israeli companies via Kushner's fund
- Israeli businessman sits on Gaza governance board
- Defense integration infrastructure operational
- Same consortium captures US tech/gaming assets

### Key Individuals Across Multiple Channels

| Individual | Affinity | Board of Peace | Phoenix | EA Deal |
|------------|----------|----------------|---------|---------|
| Jared Kushner | CEO | Executive Board | Investor | Partner |
| Steve Witkoff | — | Executive Board | — | — |
| Saudi PIF | Backer ($2B) | Member nation | Via Affinity | Lead investor |
| Silver Lake | — | — | — | Partner |
