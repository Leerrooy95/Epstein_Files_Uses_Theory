## Executive Summary

This document provides granular detail on two critical blind spots identified in prior research:

1. **The Phoenix Settlement Portfolio**: Specific company holdings, stake percentages, and documented activities linking Gulf sovereign capital to Israeli settlement infrastructure
2. **The "New Gaza" Master Plan**: Detailed zoning analysis, population implications, and the Board of Peace governance structure

The throughline: Gulf sovereign wealth (via Affinity Partners) now profits from the settlement enterprise, while the same network of actors (Kushner, Gabay, Witkoff) designs the post-war reconstruction of Gaza as a privatized real estate venture.

## 1. The Phoenix Settlement Portfolio: Company-by-Company Breakdown

### Overview

Phoenix Financial Ltd. (formerly Phoenix Holdings) is one of Israel's largest insurance and asset management companies, with approximately ₪500 billion (~$137 billion) in assets under management. Affinity Partners, Jared Kushner's private equity firm backed by Saudi PIF ($2B), Qatar, and UAE, owns ~9.9% of Phoenix—making it the largest single shareholder.

Through Phoenix's holdings in other Israeli companies, Gulf sovereign capital now has financial exposure to companies listed on the UN OHCHR database of businesses operating in illegal settlements.

### The Capital Flow Mechanism

```
Saudi PIF / Qatar / UAE ($2B+)
            ↓
    Affinity Partners (Miami)
            ↓
    Phoenix Financial (~9.9% stake)
            ↓
    Israeli Banks, Telecom, Infrastructure, Retail, Energy
            ↓
    Settlement financing, construction, services
            ↓
    Dividends flow back through the chain
```

**The "Passive LP" Defense**: Affinity maintains its Gulf investors (PIF, QIA, Abu Dhabi funds) have no operational role. However, dividends generated by Bank Leumi's mortgages in Ariel or Shufersal's sales in Ma'ale Adumim flow back, through Phoenix and Affinity, to the sovereign wealth funds of the Gulf.

## 2. The "New Gaza" Master Plan: Forensic Analysis

### Presentation Context

**Date**: January 22, 2026  
**Venue**: World Economic Forum, Davos, Switzerland  
**Presenters**: Jared Kushner (primary), with Yakir Gabay credited as key architect  
**Format**: Slide deck with AI-generated renderings

### Zoning Overview

The plan divides Gaza into distinct zones that fundamentally alter the pre-war urban fabric:

| Zone Type | Description | Pre-War Reality |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Coastal Tourism** | Entire Mediterranean coastline; 180 "mixed-use" luxury towers; tree-lined promenade | Apartment buildings, local hotels, cafes, public beaches—"only escape from densely packed terrain" |
| **Industrial/Data Centers** | Large zones "equal in size to or larger than" residential areas; data centers, advanced manufacturing | 87% urban area per UN-Habitat |
| **Residential Districts** | Four disconnected areas: Rafah, Khan Younis, Center Camps, Gaza City | Continuous urban fabric |
| **Agricultural/Green** | Northern areas (Beit Lahia, Jabalia) converted | Existing urban centers |
| **Port/Airport** | Southwestern end near Egypt border | Site of previous Gaza airport (destroyed 20+ years ago) |

### The Housing Math

| Metric | Plan | Pre-War Need | Gap |
|--------|------|--------------|-----|
| Housing Units | ~100,000 (New Rafah focus) | 600,000+ | 500,000+ units |
| Population Implied | Significantly reduced | 2.2 million | Questions about displacement |
| Urban Area | ~13% (per plan zoning) | 87% (UN-Habitat) | 74% reduction |

**NPR Analysis**: "The plan leaves far less room for Palestinian housing than existed before the war, suggesting a smaller population in Gaza."

### Key Features

**"New Rafah"**:
- 100,000+ permanent housing units
- 200+ schools
- 75+ medical facilities
- 2-3 year construction timeline (per Kushner)

**"New Gaza"**:
- Center of industry
- Data centers and digital infrastructure
- Target: 100% employment, 500,000+ jobs
- GDP projection: $10B+ by 2035 (vs. $362M in 2024)

**Coastline**:
- 180 mixed-use towers
- "Coastal tourism" designation
- Resembles "Billionaire's Row" / Dubai aesthetic
- Critics: "Vegas-ification of Gaza" (Prof. Ali Alraouf)

### What's Missing

Per NPR, Al Jazeera, and CNN analysis:

1. **Land deed transfers**: No reference to how ownership will work
2. **Housing allocation**: No explanation of how new units will be distributed
3. **Displacement process**: No detail on how families will be relocated from existing buildings
4. **Palestinian consultation**: "Unclear if any Palestinians were consulted" (NPR)
5. **International stabilization force**: Notably absent from presentation despite being part of the 20-point plan
6. **Funding sources**: Kushner "did not specify who would fund the redevelopment"

### Conditionality: "Security First"

The entire plan is conditional on:
1. Full Hamas disarmament
2. Israeli military withdrawal (only after disarmament)
3. Demilitarization verification

**Mechanism**: Reconstruction aid is leveraged to enforce security compliance, with the Board of Peace controlling disbursement.

**Kushner Quote**: "Number one thing is going to be security. Without security, nobody's going to make investments, nobody's gonna come build there."

### The "Catastrophic Success" Doctrine

Kushner has used the phrase "catastrophic success" to describe expected outcomes.

**Interpretation**: Success of the project (high-value real estate, economic integration, security) may come at the "catastrophic" cost of erasing Gaza's pre-existing social and urban fabric.

**Source**: Gabay associates quoted in Ynet: "Prepare ourselves for a catastrophic success."

## 3. The Board of Peace: Governance Architecture

### Membership Tiers

| Tier | Requirement | Duration | Authority |
|------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| **Permanent** | $1 billion contribution | Unlimited | Presumed veto/voting rights insulated from rotation |
| **Term** | No contribution | 3 years | Renewal at Chairman's sole discretion |

### Chairman Authority (Trump)

Per the charter:
- **Tenure**: Lifetime, or until voluntary resignation
- **Removal**: Only for incapacity, requiring unanimous Executive Board vote
- **Powers**: Sole authority to approve decisions, appoint members, dismiss members unilaterally
- **Veto**: Holds veto power over key decisions

### Executive Board (Tier 1)

| Member | Role |
|--------|------|
| Donald Trump | Chairman (lifetime) |
| Marco Rubio | U.S. Secretary of State; Diplomatic Lead |
| Steve Witkoff | Special Envoy; Real Estate/Reconstruction Lead |
| Jared Kushner | Senior Adviser; "New Gaza" architect; Gulf liaison |
| Tony Blair | Former UK PM; International legitimacy |
| Ajay Banga | World Bank President; Financial integration |
| Marc Rowan | Apollo Global Management CEO; Private capital |
| Robert Gabriel Jr. | U.S. Deputy National Security Adviser; Security |

### Gaza Executive Board (Tier 2)

| Member | Affiliation |
|--------|-------------|
| Steve Witkoff | U.S. Special Envoy |
| Jared Kushner | Affinity Partners |
| Tony Blair | Former UK PM |
| Marc Rowan | Apollo Global |
| Hakan Fidan | Turkish Foreign Minister |
| Ali Al-Thawadi | Qatar strategic affairs |
| Gen. Hassan Rashad | Egyptian intelligence chief |
| Reem Al-Hashimy | UAE Minister of State |
| Nickolay Mladenov | High Representative for Gaza |
| **Yakir Gabay** | Israeli billionaire; "international adviser" |
| Sigrid Kaag | UN coordinator |

### Signatories vs. Refusals

**Signed (25 of 62 invited, as of late January 2026)**:
- Gulf: Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain
- Middle East: Turkey, Egypt, Jordan, Israel (via Gabay)
- Asia: Indonesia, Vietnam, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Armenia
- Europe: Hungary, Bulgaria, Kosovo
- Americas: Argentina, Paraguay
- Africa: Morocco

**Declined**:
- France: Charter "goes beyond sole framework of Gaza"; "contrary to UN Charter"
- UK: "Legal treaty that raises much broader issues"; concern over Russia invitation
- Germany: Cannot accept "on constitutional grounds"
- Sweden: Will not sign with "current text"
- Norway: "Raises a number of questions"
- Slovenia: "Dangerously interferes with broader international order"
- New Zealand: Would not add "significant value"; must be "complementary to UN Charter"
- Belgium: Explicitly denied signing (corrected White House list)
- Canada: Invitation rescinded by Trump

**Pending/Non-Responsive**:
- Russia: Putin "studying details"; proposed sending $1B from frozen U.S. assets
- China: Cautious; has own Global Governance Initiative
- European Union (as bloc)
- Ukraine

### Charter Scope

**Critical Finding**: The 11-page charter makes no direct mention of Gaza.

Per NBC News: The charter proposes "a broad mandate for a new international organization that 'seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict.'"

**Critics**: The Guardian described it as a "pay-to-play club" centered on Trump's affairs rather than Gaza reconstruction.

## 4. The Convergence: Actors Across Channels

### Kushner's Position

| Role | Channel |
|------|---------|
| CEO, Affinity Partners | Controls ~9.9% of Phoenix; routes Gulf capital to Israeli financial system |
| Board of Peace Executive Board | Senior Adviser |
| Gaza Executive Board | Member |
| "New Gaza" Plan | Primary presenter; architect |
| Witkoff Adviser | Reportedly advising on ceasefire negotiations |

### Yakir Gabay's Position

| Role | Channel |
|------|---------|
| Gaza Executive Board | Member (as "international adviser," not Israeli government rep) |
| "New Gaza" Plan | Key architect (per NPR, Kushner credit) |
| Kushner/Witkoff Collaboration | Working on Gaza master plan since late 2023 |
| Bank Leumi Background | Former CEO of underwriting unit |

### The Overlap

The same individuals designing Gaza's reconstruction (Kushner, Gabay) are financially connected to:
- Settlement financing (via Phoenix holdings)
- Gulf sovereign wealth (via Affinity LP structure)
- Board of Peace governance (via Executive Board positions)

---

## 5. Structural Implications

### "Capital for Integration" vs. "Land for Peace"

The traditional formula—land concessions in exchange for peace agreements—has been superseded by a capital-based model:

1. **Profit from Status Quo**: Settlement enterprise profitability now benefits Gulf investors
2. **Plausible Deniability**: U.S. private equity (Affinity) creates legal/optical buffer
3. **Leverage Without Treaties**: Gulf capital gains influence over Israeli economy without formal normalization

### The Housing Deficit Question

Pre-war Gaza: 2.2 million people, 87% urban, needed 600,000+ housing units
"New Gaza" plan: ~100,000 units in concentrated residential districts

**The math implies either**:
- Massive population reduction
- Extreme density in designated residential zones
- Unaddressed displacement

### Governance Privatization

The Board of Peace creates a governance structure where:
- Membership is purchased ($1B for permanence)
- Authority is centralized in one individual (lifetime chairman)
- UN-adjacent legitimacy is claimed without UN constraints
- Gaza reconstruction is controlled by actors with financial interests in Israeli settlements

---

## 6. Open Research Questions

1. **Dividend Flow**: Can specific dividend payments from Phoenix holdings to Affinity (and thus to Gulf LPs) be documented?

2. **Gabay's Plan Details**: What were the specifics of the reconstruction plan Gabay developed before joining the official structure?

3. **Data Center Operators**: Which companies are positioned to operate the "New Gaza" data centers? Any Consortium overlap (Oracle, etc.)?

4. **$1B Contributors**: Have any nations actually paid the $1B for permanent membership? Where do the funds go?

5. **Israeli Government Role**: Beyond Gabay as "international adviser," what is the formal Israeli government position on "New Gaza" zoning?

6. **Palestinian Land Records**: How do "New Gaza" zones overlay with pre-war property ownership?
