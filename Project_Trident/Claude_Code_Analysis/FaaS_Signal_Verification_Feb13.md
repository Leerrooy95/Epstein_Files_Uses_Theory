## Signal 1: High-Volume Recruitment for "Chaos" Protesters in Los Angeles

**Reported Signal Strength:** 9/10
**Reported Rate Card:** $6,500-$12,500/week

### Verification

| Claim | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Craigslist ads offering $6,500-$12,500/week for "chaos" protesters in LA | The specific ad matching this description was debunked in June 2025 as a **prank** posted by Joey LaFleur, host of the "Goofcon1" podcast | DEBUNKED |
| Ad posted day before LA protests | Confirmed — ad was posted June 5, 2025, one day before LA immigration protests | Confirmed (timing) |
| Ad creator admitted prank | Yes — LaFleur told AP he "had no idea it was ever going to be connected to the riots" | Confirmed |
| Similar ads recirculated in Jan 2026 | Yes — a "STOP TRUMP" Philadelphia Craigslist ad circulated during Jan 2026 protests, but was traced to a **2016 original** | DEBUNKED |
| Fact-check consensus | PolitiFact, FactCheck.org, and Snopes all determined ads were pranks or recycled images | High confidence |

### Assessment: SIGNAL STRENGTH REVISED TO 2/10

The core evidence for Signal 1 — Craigslist ads offering $6,500-$12,500/week — has been **debunked by multiple independent fact-checkers**. The original June 2025 ad was a prank by a podcast host. The January 2026 ad was a recycled 2016 image.

**This does not mean paid mobilization infrastructure doesn't exist.** It means this specific signal is not evidence of it. The FaaS monitoring framework should distinguish between:
- **Verified mobilization infrastructure** (documented entities like Crowds on Demand, which is a real company)
- **Viral misinformation about paid protesters** (a recurring pattern across multiple protest cycles since 2017)

The "paid protesters" narrative itself may function as a form of friction — it delegitimizes organic protest by implying astroturfing, regardless of whether any actual paid mobilization is occurring.

## Signal 2: Event Staffing Surge via Kinetic Events in Major Hubs

**Reported Signal Strength:** 7/10
**Reported Rate Card:** $20-$30/hour

### Verification

| Claim | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Kinetic Events is actively hiring event staff in DC, NYC, LA, Austin | Kinetic Events is a **real, legitimate event staffing company** that regularly hires for conferences, activations, and corporate events | Verified (company exists) |
| Listings on ZipRecruiter and Indeed for brand ambassadors | Standard event staffing listings exist across these platforms year-round | Verified (standard) |
| $20-$30/hour rate | Consistent with standard event staffing rates in major metros | Verified (market rate) |
| CES 2026 prep | CES is a real annual event; staffing agencies hire for it routinely | Verified (standard) |
| "Russian Doll" structure linking to Hawthorn Group | No evidence found linking Kinetic Events to Hawthorn Group or astroturfing operations | NOT VERIFIED |
| Connection to FY26 spending bills | No evidence event staffing surge is timed to legislative events | NOT VERIFIED |

### Assessment: SIGNAL STRENGTH REVISED TO 3/10

Kinetic Events is a legitimate event staffing company. Hiring surges for brand ambassadors and event staff at $20-$30/hour in major metros is **entirely normal commercial activity**, particularly around conference seasons.

The signal conflates standard gig-economy event staffing with mobilization infrastructure. Without specific evidence connecting these staffing entities to political operations or astroturfing firms, this signal is **noise**.

**To be useful, this signal would need:**
1. Specific postings referencing political events (not just general "event staff")
2. Documented financial links between the staffing entity and a political operation
3. Unusual surge patterns that deviate from normal conference/event cycles

## Signal 3: Urgent Gig Postings on Craigslist and X for Protest-Adjacent Roles

**Reported Signal Strength:** 6/10
**Reported Rate Card:** $24-$30/hour

### Verification

| Claim | Finding | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Gig economy listings for "event staff" in LA/Orange County with daily pay | Standard gig listings exist in these areas year-round | Not specifically verified as unusual |
| X posts highlight urgent hires for operations support in DC | Unverified — no specific posts cited | NOT VERIFIED |
| Alignment with Free America Walkout, No Kings rallies | These protests are real events; but no verified link to paid staffing | Partially verified (protests are real) |
| Within 72 hours of DHS shutdown risk | Yes — DHS shutdown begins Feb 14, 2026 | Verified (timing) |
| No clear parent entity | Correct — no entity identified | N/A |
| "Echoes Crowds on Demand tactics" | Crowds on Demand is a real company; but no evidence these specific postings connect to it | NOT VERIFIED |

### Assessment: SIGNAL STRENGTH REVISED TO 3/10

The timing correlation with the DHS shutdown (Feb 14) is real, but the underlying evidence — generic gig postings for event staff — does not distinguish between normal labor market activity and mobilization infrastructure.

## The Compliance Event Alignment

The one element of the FaaS daily log that **does** verify is the "compliance event" identification:

| Event | Timing | Status |
|---|---|---|
| DHS shutdown | Feb 14, 2026 (12:01 AM Saturday) | VERIFIED — all but certain per CNBC, CNN, The Hill |
| Devon Energy-Coterra merger ($21.4B) | Announced Feb 2, 2026; awaiting regulatory/shareholder approval | VERIFIED |
| FY26 appropriations aid cuts | Passed (rest of government funded through Sep 30) | VERIFIED |

The DHS shutdown is the most significant near-term compliance event. It is verified and imminent. Whether protest activity near this deadline constitutes "masking" or simply reflects organic citizen response to a funding lapse affecting 272,000 federal employees is the interpretive question.

## Meta-Analysis: The FaaS Framework's Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths
1. **Compliance event calendar:** The framework correctly identifies fiscal deadlines, merger announcements, and regulatory windows as events worth monitoring
2. **Rate card tracking:** Monitoring compensation structures in mobilization-adjacent industries is a legitimate OSINT technique
3. **Entity cross-referencing:** Tracing parent entities behind staffing operations is sound methodology

### Weaknesses
1. **Confirmation bias risk:** The framework is designed to find paid mobilization, which creates a tendency to interpret normal economic activity (event staffing, gig postings) as signals
2. **Craigslist ad vulnerability:** Multiple debunked Craigslist ads (2017, 2020, 2025, 2026) have been misinterpreted as evidence of paid protest infrastructure. The framework needs a more rigorous evidence threshold before assigning high signal strength
3. **Base rate problem:** Event staffing companies (Kinetic Events, etc.) hire year-round in major metros. Without establishing a baseline hiring rate, it's impossible to determine whether current hiring represents a "surge" or normal operations
4. **Organic protest conflation:** Real protests (No Kings rallies, Free America Walkout, ICE response protests) are occurring because real policy events (DHS shutdown, ICE shootings of citizens) are happening. Framing all protest activity as potentially "FaaS" risks delegitimizing genuine civic engagement

### Recommendation for Framework Improvement

| Current Practice | Recommended Practice |
|---|---|
| Assign signal strength based on keyword match | Require verified entity link before assigning >5/10 |
| Treat all Craigslist ads as potential signals | Cross-check against fact-check databases before reporting |
| Assume unusual hiring patterns | Establish base rate for event staffing hiring in each hub |
| Frame all protest activity as potentially paid | Distinguish between organic civic response and documented astroturfing |

## The Real Signal: DHS Shutdown as Friction Event

The most analytically significant finding from this FaaS sweep is not the (debunked) paid protest ads — it's the DHS shutdown itself:

1. **DHS shuts down Feb 14** — 272,000 employees affected; TSA workers without pay; ICE/CBP continue with prior-year funding
2. **Congress recessed until Feb 23** — minimum 10-day shutdown window
3. **The dispute centers on ICE reform** — Democrats demanding body cameras, use-of-force policies after Pretti shooting; Republicans demanding sanctuary city crackdowns
4. **ISF troop deployments proceeding** — Indonesia (8,000 troops) preparing for Gaza deployment while DHS can't fund TSA
5. **BoP Summit Feb 19** — Board of Peace first session occurs during DHS shutdown, with Congress in recess

The structural irony: the US government cannot fund its own Department of Homeland Security while simultaneously standing up an international security force (ISF) under the Board of Peace for Gaza governance. This is the kind of structural observation the FaaS framework should elevate over debunked Craigslist ads.
