# Project Trident Report: Temporal Correlations in Tech and Ritual Datasets (2024-2025)

## Overview
This report documents temporal patterns between ritual events and technology/infrastructure milestones, based on cross-referenced datasets including `israel_tech_research_2015_2025.csv` and `anchor_events_parsed.csv`. Analysis focuses on lags and clustering within ±14-day windows, with a Pearson correlation of **r = 0.6196** for 14-day lags.
