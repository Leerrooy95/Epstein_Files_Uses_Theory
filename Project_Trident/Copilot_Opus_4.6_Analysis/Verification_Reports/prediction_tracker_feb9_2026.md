## Detailed Verification

### Prediction 1: Event Clustering at File Deadlines ✅ CONFIRMED

The repository predicted that friction and compliance events would cluster
around document release deadlines. The January 30-February 1, 2026 window
confirmed this:

| Date | Event | Type |
|------|-------|------|
| Jan 30-31 | DOJ releases 3M+ pages of Epstein files | Friction |
| Jan 30 | Venezuela amnesty announced; El Helicoide closure signed | Compliance |
| Feb 1 | WSJ reports Trump-UAE $500M World Liberty Financial deal | Financial |
| Feb 1-2 | Tu BiShvat (Jewish New Year for Trees) | Calendar anchor |
| Feb 3-4 | Met Police confirms Mandelson criminal investigation | Institutional |
| Feb 5 | House Democrats launch formal WLFI probe (Rep. Khanna) | Compliance |

**Assessment:** Five independent signal types (friction, compliance, financial,
calendar, institutional) converged in a 6-day window — consistent with the
convergence model documented in the README.

### Prediction 2: Tu BiShvat Policy Action ⚠️ DATE DISCREPANCY

The README lists "Feb 12, 2026" for Tu BiShvat. However, Tu BiShvat 2026
begins at sundown on **Sunday, February 1** and ends at sundown on
**Monday, February 2**.

- Sources: Chabad.org, WinCalendar, Remitly, CalendarDate.com
- The Feb 1-2 date actually aligns with the DOJ file release (Jan 30-31)
  and the Trump-UAE deal reporting (Feb 1), which may support the prediction
  if the date is corrected.

**Recommendation:** The README prediction date should be corrected from
Feb 12 to Feb 1-2, 2026. If the date was intentional (tracking a different
anchor), this should be clarified.

### Prediction 6: Khanna Investigation — March 1 Deadline 🔄 ACTIVE

**Confirmed developments:**

- Rep. Ro Khanna (ranking Democrat, House Select Committee on China) sent
  formal letter to WLFI co-founder/CEO Zach Witkoff demanding ownership
  documentation, payment records, and internal communications.
- **Document production deadline: March 1, 2026** — confirmed by multiple
  sources (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph, The Hill, FinanceFeeds).
- Investigation scope includes:
  - $500M UAE investment (Sheikh Tahnoon, 49% stake in WLFI)
  - Whether AI chip export approvals coincided with the investment
  - Stablecoin activities and Binance-related transactions
  - Of initial $250M payment, ~$187M reportedly went to Trump-related entities
- WLFI representatives have labeled the probe as "politically motivated."
- Sen. Warren (Banking Committee) running parallel investigation.

### Prediction 7: UK Mandelson Disclosure ✅ ESCALATED BEYOND PREDICTION

The repository predicted parliamentary disclosure. What has occurred exceeds
the prediction — a full criminal investigation:

**Timeline of escalation:**
1. DOJ Epstein files released (Jan 30-31, 2026) — emails showing Mandelson
   passed confidential government information to Epstein during 2008 crisis
2. Mandelson sacked as US Ambassador designate
3. Resigned from Labour Party
4. Resigned from House of Lords
5. Met Police opened criminal investigation (misconduct in public office —
   maximum penalty: life imprisonment)
6. **Police raided two properties** (Camden, London + Wiltshire) —
   officers removed boxes of evidence (Feb 6, 2026)
7. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Hayley Sewart: "This will be a complex
   investigation... we will not be providing a running commentary"
8. UK Parliament voted unanimously to disclose vetting documents
9. PM Starmer described Mandelson's actions as "disgraceful"

**Palantir connection under review:**
- Palantir's Global Counsel hired Mandelson while Epstein was still active
  Valar Ventures partner
- Palantir holds £670M+ in UK contracts (NHS FDP: £330M-£500M; MoD: £240M)
- Green Party leader Zack Polanski called for contracts to be scrapped
- MoD signed new £240M deal on Jan 29, 2026 — same week as Epstein files
- Switzerland previously rejected Palantir over national security concerns

### Prediction 8: Arkansas PSC Order Text 🔄 PENDING

**Confirmed developments:**
- PSC approved Jefferson Power Station on January 28, 2026 (Docket 25-047-U)
- PSC explicitly found costs "not reasonable" but approved anyway
- PSC ordered future proposals must include competitive bidding
- AVAIO Digital announced "AVAIO Digital Leo" data center campus —
  $6B first phase, 150 MW initial grid power, scaling to 1 GW
- Construction expected Q1 2026; energized by June 2027
- PSC order text not yet publicly released via FOIA

## Convergence Assessment

Of the 8 tracked predictions:
- **2 confirmed** (event clustering, Mandelson disclosure)
- **1 date discrepancy** (Tu BiShvat — Feb 1-2, not Feb 12)
- **5 pending/tracking** (13F filings, DOGE instability, TikTok, Khanna, Arkansas)

The Mandelson prediction is notable because the outcome *exceeded* the
prediction — the repository predicted parliamentary disclosure, but a full
criminal investigation with property raids occurred instead. This is
consistent with the repository's core thesis that friction events (Epstein
file releases) trigger cascading institutional responses.

The Jan 30-Feb 2 window also demonstrates the convergence model:
DOJ files (friction), Venezuela amnesty (compliance), WLFI deal (financial),
Tu BiShvat (calendar anchor), and Mandelson investigation (institutional)
all clustered in the same window without requiring coordination.
