## ⚠️ Transparency Notice

This report was generated by an AI language model.  The verification checks
described below are real (scripts were executed, web searches were performed),
but the interpretation is automated.  Independent human review is recommended.

---

## 1. Script Execution Results

All seven statistical test scripts were re-executed from a clean environment.
Dependencies: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `statsmodels` (all installed fresh).

| Script | Runs? | Output Matches Documented Results? | Notes |
|--------|-------|------------------------------------|-------|
| `permutation_test.py` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Part 1: r=0.6196 (2-wk lag, p=0.0010). Part 2 Core: r=0.6192, Spearman ρ=0.0215. Full: r=0.5282, ρ=0.1704. All match. |
| `year_distribution_audit.py` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | 2025 is 4.3× avg (slight update from originally reported 4.7× — likely due to dataset additions since first run). Year distribution patterns match. |
| `autocorrelation_adjusted_test.py` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Core DW=1.29, block-boot Pearson p=0.0004, Spearman p=0.78. Full DW=1.82, block-boot Pearson p=0.0001, Spearman p=0.0073. All match documented values. |
| `normalized_correlation.py` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Core z-score r=0.2304, full z-score r=0.2854. Binary core r=-0.4058, full r=-0.1943. All match documented ranges. |
| `cross_validation_dec2025.py` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Dec-excluded core: r=0.0599 (p=0.39). Dec-excluded full: r=0.0926 (p=0.12). 90% and 82% drops respectively. Match. |
| `rolling_window_correlation.py` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | 26-wk core mean r=0.1962 (documented ~0.20), 11% windows >0.3 (match). Full scope 28% windows >0.3 (match). |
| `event_study_framework.py` | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Post/pre ratio at 14d: 0.56x core (match), 0.74x full. Random baseline 3.5x (match). No post-friction clustering (p=1.0). |

**Verdict:** All scripts execute without errors and produce results consistent
with the documented findings.  Minor numerical variations (e.g., 4.3× vs 4.7×
for year skew) are expected due to dataset additions between the original run
and this re-execution.

## 2. Statistical Methodology Review

Each script was reviewed for methodological correctness:

### permutation_test.py
- **Correct:** Uses conservative p-value formula `(exceed + 1) / (N + 1)` ✅
- **Correct:** Tests both Pearson and Spearman ✅
- **Correct:** Seeds RNG for reproducibility ✅
- **Correct:** Handles NaN values in lagged analysis ✅
- **Note:** Part 1 uses 1,000 permutations (sufficient for n=30), Part 2 uses
  10,000 (appropriate for n=213+ weekly bins)

### year_distribution_audit.py
- **Correct:** Scans all CSV files recursively ✅
- **Correct:** Handles multiple date column names ✅
- **Correct:** Distinguishes scraping artifact vs genuine spike ✅
- **Minor:** Suppresses `FutureWarning` — acceptable for analysis scripts

### autocorrelation_adjusted_test.py
- **Correct:** Durbin-Watson computed on OLS residuals (proper method) ✅
- **Correct:** Block size heuristic based on Politis & Romano (1994) ✅
- **Correct:** Caps block size at n/4, floors at 2 ✅
- **Correct:** 10,000 bootstrap iterations (adequate resolution) ✅
- **Note:** Block bootstrap resamples friction series against fixed compliance
  series — this is the standard approach for testing cross-correlation

### normalized_correlation.py
- **Correct:** Three independent normalization methods ✅
- **Correct:** Handles constant series (std=0 → 1.0) to avoid division by zero ✅
- **Correct:** Z-score within year preserves within-year patterns ✅
- **Correct:** Binary analysis properly captures presence/absence ✅

### cross_validation_dec2025.py
- **Correct:** Uses period-based filtering (start_time accessor) ✅
- **Correct:** Tests progressive exclusion windows ✅
- **Correct:** Handles constant-series edge case ✅
- **Correct:** Reports both Pearson and Spearman for all subsets ✅

### rolling_window_correlation.py
- **Correct:** Tests multiple window sizes (13, 26, 52 weeks) ✅
- **Correct:** Skips windows with constant series ✅
- **Correct:** Regime analysis splits into equal thirds ✅
- **Note:** Reports both top-5 and bottom-5 windows for balance

### event_study_framework.py
- **Correct:** Pre vs post comparison with Mann-Whitney U ✅
- **Correct:** One-sided test (alternative='greater') — appropriate ✅
- **Correct:** Random baseline comparison (1,000 Monte Carlo samples) ✅
- **Correct:** Per-category breakdown for granularity ✅
- **Note:** Overlapping windows between nearby friction events are acknowledged
  in the limitations section

**Overall Methodology Verdict:** The statistical approach across all seven
scripts is sound.  Methods are standard, appropriate for the data type (weekly
time series with sparse events), and properly documented with limitations.

## 3. Factual Claim Verification

Key factual claims referenced in The_Trident.md and the correlation_summary.md
were verified via web search against authoritative sources:

| Claim | Source Cited | Verification Result | Status |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| CFIUS § 800.307 passive LP exemption exists | 31 CFR § 800.307 | ✅ Confirmed via eCFR, Cornell Law, and legal firm analyses | Legitimate |
| Sanabil (Saudi PIF subsidiary) is LP in Founders Fund | Multiple reports | ✅ Confirmed — Sanabil is a PIF subsidiary and was reported as LP in Founders Fund. Exact stake not publicly disclosed. | Legitimate |
| Founders Fund deployed $1B+ into Anduril | Industry reporting | ⚠️ Not independently verified in this session — Founders Fund is a known Anduril investor but exact cumulative amount not confirmed | Plausible but unverified amount |
| Mubadala owns ~81.5% of GlobalFoundries | SEC filings, Fintel | ✅ Confirmed — 81.5-82% as of late 2024 per multiple financial sources | Legitimate |
| GlobalFoundries has Category 1A Trusted Foundry | DoD DMEA TAPO | ✅ Confirmed via GlobalFoundries press releases and DoD documentation | Legitimate |
| GlobalFoundries received $1.59B in CHIPS Act funding | CHIPS Act Sec. 103(b)(5) | ⚠️ Minor discrepancy — verified amount is **$1.5 billion** (up to), not $1.59B. This claim appears in The_Trident.md (an original file, not in this folder). | Minor discrepancy in original file |
| Pentagon awarded GF $3.1B contract (2023-2033) | GF press release | ✅ Confirmed via GlobalFoundries official press release and Tom's Hardware | Legitimate |
| Gulf states excluded from CHIPS Act "countries of concern" | CHIPS Act Sec. 103(b)(5) | ✅ Confirmed — only China, Russia, Iran, North Korea are listed | Legitimate |
| SoftBank Vision Fund: $45B from Saudi PIF | Multiple reports | ✅ Well-documented in financial press | Legitimate |

**Factual Verdict:** All verifiable regulatory and financial claims check out
against authoritative sources.  One minor discrepancy noted ($1.59B vs $1.5B
for GlobalFoundries CHIPS funding) exists in an original file outside this
folder.  The Founders Fund → Anduril deployment amount ($1B+) is plausible
but the exact cumulative figure was not independently confirmed.

## 4. Dataset Integrity Check

The Datasets/ folder contains local copies of CSVs.  Verified:

| File | Rows | Date Range | Issues |
|------|------|------------|--------|
| `master_reflexive_correlation_data.csv` | 30 | Week 1-30 (no dates, index only) | None — matches Control_Proof/ original |
| `BlackRock_Timeline_Full_Decade.csv` | 674 | 2015-2025 | ✅ Well-balanced (~60/yr) |
| `Infrastructure_Forensics.csv` | 102+ | 2025 only | ⚠️ 100% 2025 — known scraping artifact |
| `Timeline_Update_Jan2026_Corrected (1).csv` | 99 | Mixed | ⚠️ Heavily 2025 |
| `Additional_Anchors_Jan2026_Final.csv` | 50 | 2025-2026 | ⚠️ 96% 2025 |
| `Biopharma.csv` | 108 | 2023-2026 | ⚠️ 73.8% 2025 |
| `High_Growth_Companies_2015_2026.csv` | 1049 | 2015-2026 | ✅ Relatively balanced |

**Dataset Verdict:** Datasets are intact and match their documented descriptions.
The 2025 skew in 4 of 7 files is a known issue, properly documented in the
year_distribution_audit.py findings and backfill_guide.md.

## 5. Findings Documents Review

### dataset_provenance.md
- **Accuracy:** Git commit history references were not re-verified against
  the GitHub API in this session, but the timeline is internally consistent
  and matches the repository structure.
- **Key finding confirmed:** Original r=0.6196 used only 30-row master CSV
  (Dec 23, 2025), New_Data_2026 uploaded Jan 4 — 12-day gap confirmed by
  folder structure.

### correlation_summary.md
- **Accuracy:** All five correlation values match script output ✅
- **Limitations table:** Accurately describes known issues ✅
- **Dataset mapping:** Correct — two independent dataset groups ✅

### new_analysis_findings.md
- **Accuracy:** Executive summary table matches re-execution results ✅
- **Interpretations:** Appropriately cautious, distinguishes statistical
  significance from practical significance ✅
- **Recommendations:** Actionable and methodologically sound ✅
- **Limitations table:** Comprehensive and honest ✅

### backfill_guide.md
- **Accuracy:** Correctly identifies skewed datasets ✅
- **Historical events suggested:** All suggested anchor events are real and
  verifiable (FAST Act 2015, CHIPS Act 2022, OPM hack 2015, etc.) ✅
- **Appropriately disclaims:** States AI should NOT fabricate events ✅

---

## 6. README Review

- **Transparency notice:** Present and appropriately prominent ✅
- **Folder structure:** Matches actual directory layout ✅
- **Work completed table:** Accurate — all entries correspond to real files ✅
- **Methodology standards:** Thorough and appropriate ✅
- **Planned work:** All 5 items marked complete, all corresponding scripts
  exist and run correctly ✅
- **Limitations table:** Comprehensive ✅

---

## 7. Issues Found

### Critical Issues
None.

### Minor Issues

1. **Year skew multiplier change:** The year_distribution_audit.py now reports
   2025 as 4.3× average (was 4.7× when first documented).  This is because
   new CSV files have been added to the repository since the original run,
   changing the overall average.  The README and findings documents should
   note that this number may shift as the repository evolves.

2. **GlobalFoundries CHIPS funding amount:** The_Trident.md (original file,
   not in this folder) states "$1.59 billion" — verified amount is "$1.5
   billion" (up to).  Recommend flagging for repository owner's attention.

3. **Founders Fund → Anduril investment amount:** Claimed as "$1B+" — this
   is plausible given Founders Fund's known portfolio but the exact cumulative
   figure was not independently confirmed.  Recommend marking as "reported"
   rather than "confirmed" in any future references.

### Observations (Not Issues)

1. The Spearman ρ near zero for core scope is consistently reproduced across
   multiple scripts — this is a genuine and important finding, not a bug.

2. The December 2025 dominance is the most robust and reproducible finding
   in the entire analysis suite.  Every test that involves temporal subsetting
   confirms it.

3. The event-study framework's finding that compliance events DON'T follow
   friction events (ratio <1.0 at 7+ days) is a significant negative result
   that deserves prominent reporting.

## 8. Conclusion

**The existing analysis in the Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis folder passes
scrutiny.**  All scripts run correctly, all documented results are
reproducible, the statistical methodology is sound, and the factual claims
that were verifiable check out against authoritative sources.  The analysis
is transparent about its limitations and appropriately cautious in its
conclusions.

The most important finding remains unchanged: the headline r ≈ 0.62
correlation is statistically real but describes a single-month phenomenon
(December 2025), not a persistent multi-year pattern.  The normalized
correlation (r ≈ 0.23) and rolling-window analysis (mean r ≈ 0.20) both
suggest a weak but genuine background signal that is dramatically amplified
by the December 2025 event cluster.
