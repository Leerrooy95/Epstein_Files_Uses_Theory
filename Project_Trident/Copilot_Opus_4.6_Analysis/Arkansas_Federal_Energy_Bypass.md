## 1. The DATA Act of 2026 (Senator Tom Cotton, S. 3585)

**Status: ✅ VERIFIED — Bill text and analysis confirmed**

### What It Does

The Decentralized Access to Technology Alternatives (DATA) Act creates a new federal utility category: the **Consumer-Regulated Electric Utility (CREU)**.

### Key Provisions

| Feature | Detail | Verification |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **CREU definition** | A utility supplying electricity to new, large electric loads (data centers, manufacturers) NOT currently served by existing retailers | ✅ Utility Dive, Kutak Rock |
| **Islanded requirement** | CREUs must be **completely physically isolated** from the bulk power grid — no backup connection to traditional utilities | ✅ Utility Dive, Data Center Dynamics |
| **Loss of exemption** | If a CREU connects to the broader grid for any reason, it immediately loses exempt status | ✅ Kutak Rock analysis |
| **FERC exemption** | CREUs exempt from FERC oversight: rate approval, reliability standards, regional transmission planning, merger review | ✅ Cotton.senate.gov, E&E News |
| **FPA/PURPA/PUHCA exemption** | Exempt from Federal Power Act, Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, and Public Utility Holding Company Act | ✅ Kutak Rock, Utility Dive |
| **State law** | Still subject to state utility laws (service territory rights, environmental, zoning/permitting) — but conflicts with state monopolies left unresolved | ✅ Kutak Rock |
| **Environmental oversight** | Not exempted from environmental regulations | ✅ Kutak Rock |

### Does This Explicitly Allow "Islanded" Power Systems Exempt from Federal Regulation?

**YES.** The CREU category explicitly creates a pathway for data centers to build physically islanded power systems that are exempt from FERC/FPA/PURPA/PUHCA regulation. The mandatory physical isolation ("islanding") is the mechanism that triggers the exemption.

### Critical Analysis

The DATA Act creates a **two-tier energy system**:
- **Tier 1 (regulated):** Existing utilities serving residential/commercial customers under FERC/state PSC oversight
- **Tier 2 (exempt):** Private, islanded power systems serving large industrial loads with zero federal utility oversight

This is structurally identical to the model Austin's project documents at the state level (Arkansas Act 373/548) — but elevated to federal law.

## 2. The RATE Act (Feb 2026) — Ratepayer Protection as Media Firewall

**Status: ⚠️ PARTIALLY VERIFIED — Concept verified at state level (Oklahoma, Pennsylvania); federal "RATE Act" introduced Feb 11, 2026 not independently confirmed as a single named bill**

### What the Research Found

The search returned the Oklahoma RATE Act (HB 2992, "Data Center Consumer Ratepayer Protection Act of 2026") rather than a single federal "RATE Act" introduced February 11. However, the pattern Austin identified is verified across multiple states:

| State | Bill | Key Provision | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| **Oklahoma** | HB 2992 | Data centers pay proportional share of new infrastructure costs; shields households from rate hikes | Filed Jan 2026 |
| **Pennsylvania** | (Pending) | "High-load customer class" — large data centers pay full grid upgrade costs | Proposed |
| **Wisconsin** | (Pending) | Data center ratepayer protection measures | Under discussion |
| **New York** | Governor's plan | Ratepayer protection plan to hold energy companies accountable | Announced |

### How "Ratepayer Protection" Serves as Media Firewall for Utility Expansion

Austin's hypothesis: The "ratepayer protection" narrative functions as a **Media Firewall** for the utility expansion required by the DATA Act.

**Assessment: ⚠️ PLAUSIBLE — structural observation, not confirmed intent**

The timing and narrative function:

1. **The DATA Act** (Jan 2026) creates the legal mechanism for private, islanded grids exempt from federal regulation
2. **Ratepayer protection bills** (Jan–Feb 2026, multiple states) create the **public justification narrative**: "We're protecting consumers from big tech's energy costs"
3. The narrative is **technically accurate** — ratepayers should be shielded from data center costs
4. But the **structural effect** is that it legitimizes the bifurcation: "Of course data centers should build their own grids — we don't want them on ours"
5. This makes the DATA Act's islanded exemption **appear consumer-friendly** rather than as a creation of unregulated private energy zones

The pattern: **Real consumer concern → legitimate legislative response → structural effect enables the very thing that should receive scrutiny (private capital building sovereign energy zones with zero federal oversight).**

## 4. Act 373 — "Strategic Investment" Rider and PSC Bypass

**Status: ✅ VERIFIED**

### Does Act 373 Allow Utilities to Bypass PSC "Necessity" Hearings?

**Yes, in select cases.** The Act:

1. **Creates a "Strategic Investment" rider** — utilities can recover construction costs incrementally during construction (not just after completion)
2. **Streamlines/partially exempts** certain "strategic investments" from the traditional Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity hearing
3. **Expedites timeline** — PSC has 6-month formalized review period (vs. open-ended traditional process)
4. **Caps rate increases** at no more than 10% below national average (with economic development exceptions)
5. **PSC retains authority** to review and impose conditions — but the structural effect is that denial becomes procedurally temporary while approval is functionally accelerated

### How This Connects to AVAIO

The AVAIO Digital Leo project ($21B, Entergy Arkansas as power provider) is exactly the type of "strategic investment" that Act 373 was designed to facilitate:
- Large power load (150MW → 1GW)
- Economic development justification ("largest investment in state history")
- Governor and legislative support
- Expedited PSC review pathway

**Act 548 (2025)** further enables aggregation: the "two or more nonadjacent" clause allows separate sites to be combined into a single tax-exempt entity.

## 5. Texas as "End State" — The Bifurcated Grid Model

**Status: ✅ VERIFIED — Model characteristics confirmed**

### ERCOT: The Target Model

| Feature | Detail | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Independence** | ERCOT covers ~90% of Texas load; deliberately isolated from national grid to avoid FERC regulation | ✅ Multiple sources |
| **Deregulation** | Since 2002 — competitive retail market, consumer choice | ✅ Electric Rates, Power Wizard |
| **Market-driven** | Real-time and day-ahead pricing set by supply/demand | ✅ ERCOT official |
| **Federal oversight** | Minimal — no FERC interstate jurisdiction | ✅ Energy Texas |
| **Data center demand** | 40-50 GW of new demand projected within a decade | ✅ PCI Energy Solutions |
| **Grid resilience** | D- rating for planning (Fox 7 Austin, citing NERC report); Winter Storm Uri exposed vulnerabilities | ✅ Multiple sources |
| **Bifurcation** | Regulated (municipal/coop monopolies) vs. deregulated (competitive retail); wholesale (ERCOT) vs. retail (private) | ✅ Fox 7 Austin |

### Trajectory Analysis

The DATA Act (federal) + Act 373 (state) + AVAIO/ADQ/ECP capital = creating the conditions for an Arkansas version of ERCOT:

```
Stage 1 (Completed): NH HB 672 — Legal precedent for islanded exemption
Stage 2 (In Progress): DATA Act — Federal CREU category with FERC exemption
Stage 3 (In Progress): Act 373/548 — State-level PSC bypass for "strategic" projects
Stage 4 (In Progress): Capital deployment — ADQ/ECP $25B + AVAIO $21B
Stage 5 (Target): Texas/ERCOT model — bifurcated grid with private capital zones
```

## 6. New Hampshire HB 672 — The "Off-Grid Legal Precedent"

**Status: ✅ VERIFIED — Law effective August 1, 2025**

### Key Provisions

| Feature | Detail | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Category** | "Off-grid electricity provider" — new legal definition | ✅ LegiScan, BillTrack50 |
| **Definition** | Entity that generates/transmits/distributes/sells electricity but is NOT connected to existing grid | ✅ NH Legislature |
| **Islanding** | Must be completely physically and electrically isolated; no backup connection | ✅ NHLA Bill Review |
| **Grid connection** | If ever connects to regulated grid, immediately loses exempt status | ✅ BillTrack50 |
| **Infrastructure** | Cannot cross state boundaries or use federal/state/municipal roadways or rights-of-way | ✅ NH Legislature |
| **Utility status** | NOT considered a public utility under state law | ✅ LegiScan |
| **Regulation** | Exempt from Title XXXIV (Public Utility Commission oversight) | ✅ NH Legislature |
| **Safety** | Must still comply with other state/local laws and safety regulations | ✅ BillTrack50 |
| **Effective date** | August 1, 2025 | ✅ NH Legislature |

### Connection to DATA Act

Austin's hypothesis — that NH HB 672 is the **legislative blueprint** for the DATA Act's CREU category — is **SUPPORTED by structural comparison**:

| Feature | NH HB 672 (2025) | DATA Act CREU (2026) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Islanding requirement** | Complete physical isolation from grid | Complete physical isolation from grid |
| **Utility exemption** | Not a public utility under state law | Exempt from FERC/FPA/PURPA/PUHCA |
| **Loss of exemption trigger** | Connection to regulated grid | Connection to broader grid |
| **Scope** | State-level (New Hampshire) | Federal |
| **Target use case** | Any off-grid provider | Large loads (data centers, manufacturers) |
| **Infrastructure restrictions** | Cannot use public rights-of-way | Not specified |

The structural DNA is nearly identical. NH HB 672 (effective Aug 2025) predates the DATA Act (introduced Jan 2026) by 5 months — consistent with a state-level pilot → federal expansion pattern.

### Key Questions for Austin's Review

1. **Who is AVAIO's $25B anchor investor?** Still undisclosed after 5 years. The ADQ/ECP partnership ($25B, 50-50, US data center power) is a verified Abu Dhabi SWF vehicle. Is ADQ/ECP the anchor?
2. **Does the DATA Act's CREU exemption apply to AVAIO's 1GW target?** If AVAIO builds islanded generation at the Little Rock campus, it could qualify as a CREU under the DATA Act — exempt from all federal energy regulation.
3. **RATE Act timing:** The ratepayer protection narrative emerging simultaneously across Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and New York (Jan–Feb 2026) — does this function as coordinated political cover or independent state responses to the same problem?
4. **Act 373 + AVAIO:** The Jefferson Power Station ($1.5B, PSC approved despite finding cost "not reasonable") and AVAIO ($21B, Entergy Arkansas as provider) — are these the same pipeline?
