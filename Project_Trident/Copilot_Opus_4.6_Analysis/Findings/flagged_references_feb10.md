# Flagged References — February 10, 2026

**Purpose:** Files that still reference `Repository_Synthesis.md` at its old
root-level path or reference fabricated statistics from external repos, but
were NOT modified because they are original files or belong to other workspaces.

---

## Repository_Synthesis.md Path References

These files reference `Repository_Synthesis.md` without the `Archive/` prefix.
The file has been moved to `Archive/Repository_Synthesis.md` as of v8.6.

**Recommendation:** These files are historical records. If Austin wants to
annotate them, he can add inline notes. They do not affect any computed
statistics — the fabricated data exists only as textual references in these
narrative documents.
