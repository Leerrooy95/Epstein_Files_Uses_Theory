# Granger Causality Test Results — February 8, 2026

**Purpose:** Test whether friction event counts *Granger-cause* compliance
event counts (or vice versa) — a stronger test than simple correlation that
examines predictive *direction*.

## ⚠️ Transparency Notice

This document was generated by an AI language model.  Granger causality is
a statistical concept that tests predictive information flow, NOT proof of
real-world causation.  All results should be independently verified.

## What Is Granger Causality?

Standard correlation tells you: "do friction and compliance move together?"

Granger causality asks the deeper question: "does knowing past friction
values improve my ability to predict *current* compliance values, beyond
what past compliance values alone tell me?"

If friction Granger-causes compliance, then friction contains predictive
information about future compliance that compliance's own history does not.
This is consistent with (but does not prove) a sequential mechanism:
friction → delay → compliance response.

## Results

### Original 30-Row Master CSV (Hand-Scored Indices)

| Direction | Lag 1 | Lag 2 | Lag 3 | Lag 4 |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Friction → Compliance | ✅ p=0.0008 | ✅ p=0.0273 | ✗ p=0.34 | ✗ p=0.50 |
| Compliance → Friction | ✅ p=0.0219 | ✗ p=0.54 | ✗ p=0.71 | ✗ p=0.95 |

**Interpretation:** In the original 30-row dataset, friction Granger-causes
compliance at lags 1-2 weeks.  Compliance also Granger-causes friction at
lag 1, but the effect is weaker and limited to a single lag.  This is
**partially consistent** with the sequential mechanism — friction does
contain predictive information about near-future compliance.

**Caveat:** With only 30 rows and 4 lags, statistical power is limited.

### Core Scope (Event Counts, excl. High_Growth_Companies)

| Direction | Lags 1-8 | Strongest Lag |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Friction → Compliance | ✗ None significant | N/A |
| Compliance → Friction | ✅ ALL significant (p<0.0001) | Lag 1 (F=46.0) |

**Interpretation:** A striking REVERSE finding.  Past compliance strongly
predicts future friction at every tested lag, but past friction has *zero*
predictive power over future compliance.

This means: knowing what compliance events happened last week helps predict
friction events this week, but NOT the other way around.

**Possible explanations:**
1. Compliance events (e.g., corporate deals, policy announcements) trigger
   media coverage and political friction as a *response*
2. The high autocorrelation in compliance (lag-1 r=0.59) may inflate the
   Granger test, especially since compliance events are more frequent
3. Compliance events may be proxies for "busy periods" that naturally
   attract both compliance and friction activity

### Full Scope (Event Counts, incl. High_Growth_Companies)

| Direction | Lags 1-8 | Strongest Lag |
|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Friction → Compliance | ✅ ALL significant (p<0.001) | Lag 1 (F=32.3) |
| Compliance → Friction | ✅ ALL significant (p<0.001) | Lag 1 (F=15.7) |

**Interpretation:** When High_Growth_Companies events are included, BOTH
directions show strong Granger causality.  This is **bidirectional** — each
series predicts the other.

Bidirectional Granger causality typically indicates a **common driver**:
both friction and compliance events respond to the same underlying triggers
(e.g., political calendar, fiscal deadlines, news cycles) rather than one
causing the other in a simple sequential chain.

## How This Connects to Previous Findings

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Event-study: post-friction ratio <1.0 | Compliance doesn't cluster *after* friction |
| Granger (core): compliance → friction only | Compliance *predicts* friction, not vice versa |
| Granger (full): bidirectional | Common driver, not sequential mechanism |
| Granger (original 30-row): friction → compliance at lags 1-2 | Supports the thesis in the hand-scored data |
| Dec 2025 exclusion destroys correlation | Both Granger directions likely driven by Dec 2025 density |

**Synthesis:** The original 30-row hand-scored dataset — where Austin
manually rated friction and compliance intensity on a 1-10 scale — does
show friction Granger-causing compliance at 1-2 week lags.  This is
consistent with the thesis.

However, when the same question is tested on the larger event-count
datasets, the result is either reversed (core: compliance predicts friction)
or bidirectional (full: both predict each other).  This suggests the
automated event classification may not capture the same nuance as the
hand-scored indices, or that the sequential mechanism only operates at
the level of intensity (hand-scored) rather than raw event counts.

## Limitations

| Limitation | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Granger tests assume stationarity | Series may have trends or structural breaks that violate this |
| High autocorrelation inflates low-lag results | DW ≈ 1.29 for core scope — lag-1 Granger may be overstated |
| "Granger causality" ≠ real causation | Tests information flow, not mechanism |
| Small sample for 30-row test | Only 4 lags testable with 30 observations |
| Dec 2025 dominance | Dense cluster may drive all results |
| Category classification is rule-based | Automated friction/compliance labels may not match hand-scored intensity |

---

## Recommendations

1. **Re-run Granger tests excluding December 2025** to check whether the
   directional findings survive without the dominant cluster.

2. **Consider the hand-scored vs event-count discrepancy** as a research
   question: does the sequential mechanism operate at the *intensity*
   level (which the hand-scored indices capture) rather than the *frequency*
   level (which event counts measure)?

3. **Test with differenced series** (first differences: Δfriction, Δcompliance)
   to address stationarity concerns before drawing causal conclusions.

4. **Report the directional asymmetry prominently:** the core-scope finding
   that compliance → friction (but NOT friction → compliance) is unexpected
   and analytically interesting regardless of the ultimate interpretation.
