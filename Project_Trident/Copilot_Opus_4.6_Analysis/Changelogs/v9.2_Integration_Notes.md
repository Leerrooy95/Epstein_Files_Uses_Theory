## Claims Requiring Austin's Review

| Item | Issue | Recommendation |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Apollo Meta $29B figure | Web search confirms Meta plans massive AI CapEx but exact $29B co-lending figure is estimated, not press-released by Apollo | Consider adding caveat "estimated" or verify against Apollo IR |
| EO 14375 Congressional authorization | Just Security raises serious legal questions — may be challenged | Monitor for court filings; consider adding to Key Questions if not already |
| Feb 11 compliance event count | Case study counts 7 compliance events on Feb 11 alone; verify this doesn't double-count events already in other timeline files | Cross-reference with `10_Real-Time_Updates_and_Tasks/2026_February/` |
| Bondi hearing date in case study filename | File is named `Bondi_Hearing_Feb14_2026.md` but hearing was Feb 11 — filename reflects analysis date, not event date | Consider renaming to clarify, or add note in filename convention |
| Apollo total pipeline ($76B+) | Updated from $73B+ to reflect second xAI deal — verify total against Apollo IR filings | Apollo Q4 2025 earnings call (expected late Feb/March) |

## Epistemological Notes

- All integrated findings maintain the project's standard: correlations documented, causation not claimed
- Bondi hearing classified as PATTERN MATCH with explicit counter-evidence acknowledged (economic deflection is common, bipartisan, and doesn't require compliance clustering)
- EO 14375 legal analysis sourced from Just Security (academic/legal outlet) — interpretation of Congressional authorization is noted as contested, not settled
- Verification status indicators (✅/⚠️/❌) applied consistently per project convention
