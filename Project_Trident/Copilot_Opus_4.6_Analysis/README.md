# Copilot Opus 4.6 — Lead Researcher Analysis

**Analyst:** GitHub Copilot (Claude, Opus 4.6)  
**Role:** Lead Researcher — verification, methodology review, and recommendations  
**Created:** February 8, 2026  
**Repository owner:** Austin Smith ([@Leerrooy95](https://github.com/Leerrooy95))

## How This Folder Works

The repository owner builds datasets and runs correlations.  My job is to:

1. **Verify** — independently check whether reported correlations hold up
   under scrutiny (permutation tests, robustness checks, alternative methods)
2. **Recommend** — suggest improvements to datasets (coverage gaps, category
   standardization, normalization) and flag issues that could weaken findings
3. **Expand** — propose new correlation techniques and analytical approaches
   the owner may not have encountered yet (Spearman, Granger causality,
   rolling windows, event-study designs, etc.)

I do **not** build datasets or run the initial correlations — that's the
owner's work.  I receive the data and results, then analyze them here.

### `Statistical_Tests/`

Runnable Python scripts that test claims in the data.  All multi-dataset
scripts import from `original_data_loader.py` which provides standardized
access to the original pre-2026 datasets.  Anyone can execute these:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/permutation_test.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/year_distribution_audit.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/autocorrelation_adjusted_test.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/normalized_correlation.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/cross_validation_dec2025.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/rolling_window_correlation.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/event_study_framework.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/granger_causality_test.py
```

### `Datasets/`

Local copies of CSV files used by the statistical tests.  Includes:
- Original pre-2026 datasets from `Control_Proof/`, `Project_Trident/`, and `09_Silicon_Sovereignty/`
- Newly incorporated datasets from `01_Levers_and_Frictions/`, `02_Anchors_and_Financials/`, and `03_Master_Framework/`

**New_Data_2026/ files are explicitly EXCLUDED** — they were uploaded January 3, 2026
and contained 2025-only data that inflated correlations.

### `Findings/`

Active analysis documents — dataset provenance traces and backfill recommendations.

### `Verification_Reports/`

Prediction tracking — testable predictions vs real-world outcomes.

### `Archive/`

Previous analysis documents moved here for transparency.  These reference
the now-deprecated r = 0.6685 / r = 0.5268 correlations and/or were produced
before the dataset corrections.  The deprecated correlations were caused by
the user accidentally mixing New_Data_2026 datasets into verification scripts
in early January 2026 — this was a user dataset-mixing error, not an AI
computation error.  Still useful for understanding the analytical journey.

### `Consolidation_Analysis/`

Cross-domain analysis assessing whether the Infrastructure Consolidation
Pattern documented elsewhere in the repository is statistically and
structurally significant.  Evaluates consortium overlap, temporal clustering,
state-level regulatory enablement (Arkansas), and geopolitical complicating
factors (Saudi-UAE rupture, Venezuela compliance window).  All major claims
independently verified via web search.

### `FaaS_Signal_Analysis/`

Verification of SuperGrok daily task outputs for the Protests—FaaS Supply
Chain task (see `10_Real-Time_Updates_and_Tasks/Tasks/Protests_FaaS_Supply_Chain.md`).
Each document takes a SuperGrok run's signals and independently fact-checks
every claim against news sources via web search.  Claims are rated as
VERIFIED, PARTIALLY VERIFIED, UNVERIFIED, or INACCURATE.

### `Influencer_Narrative_Timing/`

Analysis of when influencers from the Media Firewall ecosystem (Tucker Carlson
Network, Daily Wire, 1789 Capital-adjacent voices) push specific narratives
(anti-NATO, anti-Israel, pro-sovereignty) relative to when the administration
executes policy actions that benefit from those narratives being accepted.
Cross-references `12_The_Media_Firewall/README.md` thesis against January 2026
and December 2025 timeline data with independent web-search verification.

### `Administrative_State_Audit/`

Deep-dive audit of the structural evolution of four federal nodes (DOGE, OPM,
DOJ, FBI) from January 2025 to February 2026.  Maps the "Infrastructure
Consolidation" mechanism applied to the Administrative State itself — a
"Closed Loop" between DOGE (The Architect), OPM (The Executioner), DOJ (The
Shield), and FBI (The Enforcer).  Each node has an individual timeline with
granular, web-search-verified events.  The wiring diagram identifies six
verified interaction channels including the MSPB feedback loop.  The repo
alignment document tests the loop against five established Friction-Compliance
model patterns (thermostat model, closed regulatory loop, Vendor-State model,
Media Firewall, calendar anchors).  Key finding: CONFIRMED closed loop with
two new elements — "recursive friction" (compliance events generate their own
cover) and "defense mechanism elimination" (MSPB appeal rights permanently
removed for ~50,000 positions).  Now includes `verification_of_wiring_diagram.md`
(7th document) — independent verification of all wiring diagram claims against
public record, plus major new finding: OPM Director Kupor's structural overlap
with the Vendor-State capital pipeline (ex-a16z, which is Sanabil/PIF-funded).
MSPB overwhelm now quantified (2,145% surge, ~12,000 cases FY2025).

## Work Completed

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Feb 8 | Created all 9 statistical test scripts (permutation, year audit, autocorrelation, normalized, Dec 2025 exclusion, rolling window, event study, Granger causality) |
| Feb 8 | Dataset provenance and backfill recommendations |
| Feb 8 | **CRITICAL FIX**: Replaced New_Data_2026 files with original pre-2026 datasets in all scripts |
| Feb 9 | Consolidation pattern significance analysis (web-verified) |
| Feb 9 | Prediction tracker: 8 README predictions tracked against real-world outcomes |
| Feb 9 | Deprecated r=0.6685 / r=0.5268 (used 2025-only datasets). Archived related analysis to `Archive/` |
| Feb 9 | Incorporated 4 previously unused datasets: `Epstein_Files_timeline.csv` (01), `pep_banking_combined.csv` (02), `MASTER_timeline_2015-2025_UPDATED.csv` (03), `updated_master_theory.csv` (03) |
| Feb 9 | Updated `original_data_loader.py` — friction events: 1,526, compliance events: 1,425 |
| Feb 9 | Updated README.md, Report.md, Run_Correlations_Yourself to use r=0.6196 as primary finding |
| Feb 9 | **CORRECTION**: Fixed χ² reproduction (was using wrong binning method — `day_of_year % 14` instead of `days_since_start % 14`; now reproduces 330.62 exactly); corrected robustness table values from actual script output; corrected Tu BiShvat date (Feb 1-2, not Feb 12); updated event colocation ratio (20-42x, not 40-60x); clarified Pearson vs Spearman sensitivity to 2025 concentration |
| Feb 9 | **v8.4 CLEANUP**: Removed all deprecated r=0.6685 / r=0.5268 references from main project files (README, Report, Glossary). Clarified in all documents that correlation issues were caused by the user accidentally mixing New_Data_2026 datasets into verification scripts in early January 2026 — this was a user dataset-mixing error, not an AI computation error. The AI tools correctly computed whatever data they were given. |
| Feb 9 | **FaaS Signal Verification**: Created `FaaS_Signal_Analysis/` subfolder. Independently verified Feb 9 SuperGrok run (3 signals, 16 claims). Result: ~~10/16 verified (62.5%)~~ → **11/16 (68.75%)** after correction. Protests and compliance events confirmed; FaaS-specific claims (rate cards, paid recruitment) unverified for these specific events. Corrected 50501 characterization (grassroots, not 501(c)(4) dark money). |
| Feb 9 | **"Both/And" Nuance Update**: After full repo re-read, added major section to FaaS verification connecting the Feb 1–13 pincer window to the broader thermostat model. Key insight: protests can be 100% grassroots AND still function as friction within the model. The question isn't whether protests are paid — it's what compliance events advance while protest friction consumes attention. Connected to VOCA freeze, USAID collapse, Saudi-UAE rupture, Board of Peace (Feb 19), and resistance collapse pattern. |
| Feb 9 | **Recommendation Verification Check**: Executed Rec 6 ("Track what moves during the friction window"). Created `recommendation_verification_feb9.md` documenting 9 compliance events within the Feb 1–19 window: sanctuary cuts, DHS isolation, Santander/Webster $12.2B deal, US-Iran nuclear talks (Muscat), Google/Wiz $32B EU deadline (Feb 10), Netanyahu visit (moved to Feb 11), DHS deadline (Feb 13), 13F disclosure deadline (Feb 14), Board of Peace summit (Feb 19). **Self-correction**: "Free America Walkout" reclassified from ❌ Unverified to ✅ Verified (major 50-state protest, 450+ events). SuperGrok accuracy revised from 62.5% to 68.75%. Also nuanced 50501 characterization (nationally not 501(c)(4), but some state hubs like Mass 50501 have registered). |
| Feb 9 | **January 2026 Signal Analysis**: Created `january_2026_signal_analysis.md` — full-month friction-compliance signal map. Identified 3 peaks (Jan 3-9 at 9/10, Jan 20-22 at 9/10, Jan 27-31 at 10/10) and 1 trough (Jan 10-16 at 4/10). 34 events verified (12 friction, 19 compliance, 3 anchors). Jan 30 is the single highest-signal day (Epstein files + Warsh Fed nomination + approaching shutdown). The 2-week lag holds across all major friction-compliance pairs. Signal escalates across the month rather than cycling at steady state. Consistent with r = 0.6196 and thermostat model. |
| Feb 9 | **Media Firewall Narrative Timing Analysis**: Created `Influencer_Narrative_Timing/` subfolder. Mapped when influencers from the Media Firewall ecosystem (Tucker Carlson, Daily Wire, 1789 Capital-adjacent voices) push specific narratives (anti-NATO, anti-Israel, pro-sovereignty) against when the administration executes policy actions that benefit from those narratives being accepted. Key findings: (1) Tucker Carlson's "NATO is dead" narrative launched Jan 6–8, precisely 14–16 days before TikTok deal + Board of Peace signing on Jan 22 — matching 2-week lag. (2) Consistent structural silence on financial architecture (MGX, Silver Lake, Board of Peace capital structure, Gulf sovereign flows) across entire Dec 2025–Jan 2026 period. (3) Candace Owens departure (March 2024) functions as boundary marker — anti-Israel is the one narrative the firewall will not tolerate because Israel is structurally necessary to the Vendor-State model. (4) Jan 30 case study: Carlson's Epstein coverage directs anger toward intelligence agencies, not financial intermediaries — the Warsh Fed Chair nomination executes under cover of maximum Epstein friction. All events independently web-search verified. |
| Feb 10 | **AI Fabrication Case Study**: Created `Findings/AI_Fabrication_Case_Study.md` — cross-repository audit of Grok-fabricated data across 5 external repositories (Nov 16 – Dec 2, 2025). Cataloged specific fabricated metrics (dollar amounts, correlation coefficients, country-level data). Analyzed the "Yes Man" feedback loop mechanism: real events + fake data + fake sources + confirming outputs. Verified `master_reflexive_correlation_data.csv` does NOT match fabricated patterns (natural distributions, integer hand-scores, 12 unique values vs. fabricated datasets' 6 unique values in 3,275 rows). Identified ghost data in `Repository_Synthesis.md`, `README.md`, and `Report.md` (references to fabricated r = 0.42–0.69 and +25.5 pp from external repos). Confirmed all internal computations (r = 0.6196, χ² = 330.62, Mann-Whitney U p = 0.002) use only Austin's own datasets and are uncontaminated. |
| Feb 10 | **v8.6 Update**: Updated README.md and Report.md from v8.5 → v8.6. Annotated Three-Layer Model (Layers 2-3 retracted with ⚠️ notices and links to AI Fabrication Case Study). Fixed broken links to `Repository_Synthesis.md` (now at `Archive/Repository_Synthesis.md`). Added Archive/ to repository structure tree. Added AI Fabrication Case Study to deep dives navigation. Updated Connected Repositories with fabrication flags. Trimmed oldest "What's New" subsection (v8.4 Correlation Cleanup) per user request. Updated Methodology cross-repo validation note. |
| Feb 10 | **v8.6 Cleanup**: Per user request, fully removed retracted Layers 2-3 from active README.md and Report.md tables (previously only annotated with ⚠️). Created `Archive/Retracted_Three_Layer_References.md` to preserve the retracted content for transparency. Removed DOGE_Global_Effects and BRICS-NDB from Connected Repositories. Renamed "Three-Layer Model" section to "Friction-Compliance Model" in README and "Friction-Compliance Framework" in Report to reflect the cleaned single-layer focus. Updated AI_Fabrication_Case_Study.md resolution statuses. |
| Feb 10 | **Administrative State Audit**: Created `Administrative_State_Audit/` subfolder with 6 documents. Deep-dive audit of DOGE-OPM-DOJ-FBI structural evolution (Jan 2025–Feb 2026). Four granular node timelines with web-search-verified events. Wiring diagram maps 6 verified interaction channels including the MSPB neutralization feedback loop (overwhelm → delay → eliminate). Repo alignment tests closed loop against 5 established Friction-Compliance patterns — all confirmed with two new elements: "recursive friction" (compliance events generate their own cover) and "defense mechanism elimination" (MSPB rights permanently stripped for ~50,000 positions via Schedule Policy/Career rule, effective Mar 8–9, 2026). Key flags: DOGE "diffusion strategy" (staff embedded in agencies after disbanding, not actually disbanded); OPM published Schedule F rule despite 94% opposition; DOJ takes contradictory positions on DOGE's agency status; FBI decentralized to Huntsville/Redstone Arsenal (defense-contractor hub); the loop closes when Schedule Policy/Career eliminates the very appeal mechanism that was pushing back against the consolidation. |
| Feb 10 | **Wiring Diagram Verification**: Austin independently verified wiring diagram against public record — all four core nodes confirmed. Lead Analyst re-verified all claims via independent web search + followed up on new leads. Created `verification_of_wiring_diagram.md` (7 documents now in Administrative_State_Audit/). **Key new findings**: (1) OPM Director Scott Kupor = founding employee/managing partner of a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), which is directly funded by Sanabil/PIF (Saudi sovereign wealth) — structural overlap between OPM and Vendor-State capital pipeline. (2) Ed Martin removed as DOJ Weaponization Working Group head (Jan 2026) — leaked grand jury materials targeting Schiff/James; failed prosecutions (Comey, James) dismissed as unlawfully appointed. (3) MSPB overwhelm now quantified: 2,145% surge in FY2025, ~12,000 new appeals. (4) 317,000 federal employees departed in 2025 (exceeded 300K target). (5) NTEU court-ordered OPM disclosure of Schedule Policy/Career position lists due Feb 27, 2026. (6) a16z and PIF in talks for $40B AI fund. Updated wiring diagram, OPM_node_timeline, and DOJ_node_timeline with new verified details. |
| Feb 10 | **v8.7 Update**: Updated README.md and Report.md from v8.6 → v8.7. Added Administrative State Consolidation section to both documents with plain-language explanations for general audiences. Trimmed oldest "What's New" subsection (v8.5 details condensed into summary under v8.6 Highlights). Added new key questions (Schedule Policy/Career timing, Kupor-a16z structural overlap). Added NTEU and Schedule Policy/Career to predictions tables. Updated Summary in Report.md from "three" to "four connected patterns." Updated Deep Dives and audience navigation sections. Added Administrative_State_Audit/ to repo structure tree. Corrected "largest since post-WWII" to verified "levels not seen since 1973" (per GovExec). All factual claims independently re-verified via web search before commit. |
| Feb 11 | **February 2026 System Pattern Analysis**: Created `February_2026_System_Pattern_Analysis.md` — synthesis of Feb 9-11 events through friction-compliance lens. Three domains analyzed: (1) Vendor-State fragmentation (xAI 6/12 co-founders departed, SpaceX-xAI $1.25T merger, Jane Doe v. xAI deepfake class action, Oracle $248B lease stress + Blue Owl exit + Barrows v. Oracle securities fraud, Anduril drone test failures); (2) Institutional resistance (King County v. Trump 3 injunctions at 9th Circuit, Judge Leon "extreme skepticism" of Pentagon's Kelly censure theory); (3) China geopolitical shift (Zhang Youxia/Liu Zhenli purge, Wang Huning Taiwan "strike hard" statement). **Israel deep dive** added per user request: Unit 8200→Silicon Valley talent pipeline ($160B+ in alumni-founded companies), Google/Wiz $32B acquisition nearing close, NSO Group sale to US investors pending, Elbit/Rafael $65B+ order backlog vs. Anduril failures, Abraham Accords near collapse (Israel Hayom Feb 6), and structural analysis of why the Media Firewall protects Israel (load-bearing node in Vendor-State model). Also documents: Netanyahu Board of Peace accession (Feb 11), US-Iran Oman talks (Feb 6), 13F deadline (Feb 17), Gaza offensive preparations. Classification: **hybrid** — regulated friction continues in familiar domains while unregulated friction emerges from vendor product failures, capital market resistance, judicial pushback, and internal corporate fragmentation. Three claims from Austin's prompt marked UNVERIFIED (grand jury refusal, France CSAM raid, § 2387 charges). All verified claims independently web-search confirmed with 30+ source URLs. Working draft archived at `Archive/feb11_system_pattern_working_draft.md`. |
| Feb 12 | **Forensic Vetting of Board of Peace Leadership**: Created `Forensic_Vetting_Board_of_Peace.md` — forensic vetting of the "Lifeboat" hypothesis (Board of Peace as Epstein-network mutual protection structure). Four subjects investigated: (1) **Marc Rowan / Apollo**: Leon Black's $158–170M payments to Epstein VERIFIED; $62.5M USVI settlement VERIFIED; Rowan succeeded Black as CEO amid fallout VERIFIED; Rowan's personal Epstein contact UNVERIFIED — no evidence found. (2) **Sultan bin Sulayem / DP World**: No credible source identifies Bin Sulayem as "Sultan" in Epstein files — UNVERIFIED; DP World Gaza port contract UNVERIFIED (plausible candidate). (3) **Tony Blair**: May 14, 2002 Downing Street meeting with Epstein VERIFIED via declassified memos; Mandelson "safe" email VERIFIED; Mandelson now under UK criminal investigation VERIFIED; Blair ongoing Epstein relationship UNVERIFIED. (4) **Jared Kushner / Affinity Partners**: 99% foreign funding VERIFIED; $157M+ fees from Gulf sovereigns VERIFIED; Wyden/Raskin FARA loophole concerns and Special Counsel request VERIFIED; PIF → Affinity → Phoenix → settlements capital pipeline VERIFIED. **Conclusion**: "Lifeboat" hypothesis NOT SUPPORTED in strong form (no evidence of coordinated Epstein protection); "Board of Profits" thesis SUPPORTED (verified commercial conflicts of interest). Key structural finding: same capital network simultaneously profits from settlement expansion and Gaza reconstruction. All claims sourced to Senate Finance Committee, House Oversight Committee, court filings, and major investigative outlets. |
| Feb 12 | **TikTok Algorithm Anomaly Investigation**: Created `TikTok_Algorithm_Anomaly_Investigation.md` — investigation of TikTok search bar glitches, FYP collapse, keyword blocking, and content suppression around the Oracle-led takeover (Jan 22, 2026). **7 verified anomalies documented**: (1) "Israel" autocomplete glitch — appeared regardless of user input/history; (2) bizarre/ominous search suggestions ("leave America," "evacuate" themes); (3) FYP collapse — looping, foreign-language, non-personalized content; (4) Oracle data center power failure (Jan 25, snowstorm); (5) "Epstein" blocked in DMs; (6) ICE/political content suppression (#TikTokCensorship trended); (7) mass user migration to UpScrolled (surpassed TikTok in App Store). California Governor Newsom launched formal investigation (Jan 28). Independent researchers (100K+ videos analyzed) found no systematic targeted censorship but acknowledged subtle forms remain undetectable without internal data. **Connection to Vendor-State model**: anomalies are consumer-facing manifestation of Oracle infrastructure stress ($248B leases, Blue Owl exit, securities fraud). Classified as **unregulated friction**. MGX (Abu Dhabi) 15% stake noted as additional Gulf sovereign capital pipeline node. 50+ sources independently web-search verified. |
| Feb 12 | **Consolidation and Timing Analysis**: Created `February_2026_Consolidation_Timeline.md` — comprehensive consolidation timeline mapping 30+ events from Sept 2025 through Feb 2026 across seven domains (AI/compute, social media, gaming/data, media, digital finance, governance, defense). **Massie–Bondi hearing (Feb 11) analysis**: 6 verified facts documented; DOJ volume discrepancy (3.5M vs. 6M+ pages), selective redaction pattern (co-conspirators hidden, victims exposed), 2M+ documents still in processing. **Saudi Arabia capital pipeline**: PIF $575B US deals, $55B EA, $40B a16z AI fund, PIF strategy revision (15% spending cuts, 80% domestic focus). **Israel dual-track consolidation**: West Bank annexation (Feb 8) → Board of Peace accession (Feb 11) → first meeting (Feb 19). **UAE $1.4T framework**: Tahnoon/MGX across 5 domains (AI, social media, finance, governance, chips). **Entity overlap matrix**: MGX present in 5/7 tracked sectors, PIF in 4/7, Kushner/Affinity in 4/7. **WBD bid documented**: $108.4B Paramount/Skydance bid backed by PIF/QIA/L'imad ($24B equity) — same consortium attempting narrative control infrastructure. **Feb 8–19 convergence window**: 11-day cluster matching r = 0.6196 friction-compliance pattern. **New finding**: PIF strategy revision (Feb 2026) makes existing US positions more valuable as greenfield deals slow. All claims independently web-search verified with 40+ source URLs across government, mainstream news, and investigative outlets. |

### Future recommendations

- [ ] Re-run Granger causality excluding December 2025 to test robustness
- [ ] Test with first-differenced series (Δfriction, Δcompliance) to address stationarity
- [ ] Investigate the hand-scored vs event-count discrepancy in Granger direction
- [ ] Partial correlation controlling for a "political activity" index (e.g., congressional session calendar)
- [ ] Backfill earlier years per backfill_guide.md to enable fairer cross-year comparisons

## Methodology Standards

### 1. No narrative bias

This project sits at the intersection of politics, finance, and intelligence —
areas where confirmation bias is the default failure mode.  My job is to test
whether patterns in the data are statistically real, not to argue that they
prove any particular theory.

**What I will do:**
- Report results that weaken the thesis with the same prominence as results
  that strengthen it
- Flag when a finding is driven by outliers or sample composition
- Distinguish between "statistically significant" and "practically meaningful"

**What I will not do:**
- Cherry-pick time windows or subsets to make correlations look stronger
- Use loaded language ("proves," "confirms," "exposes") for statistical results
- Treat correlation as causation

### 2. Recommendations and new techniques

When reviewing datasets and correlations, I will actively suggest:

- **Dataset improvements** — missing year coverage, inconsistent categories,
  date format issues, duplicate records, normalization needs
- **Alternative statistical methods** — when a standard Pearson r may not be
  the right tool (e.g., Spearman for non-linear relationships, Granger for
  temporal causality, rolling correlations for regime changes, partial
  correlations to control for confounders)
- **Robustness checks** — ways to stress-test a finding (leave-one-out,
  bootstrap confidence intervals, sensitivity to outlier removal)
- **Visualization approaches** — plots that reveal patterns or problems
  the raw numbers might hide

I will explain *why* I'm suggesting each technique in plain language so the
owner can learn the methodology, not just receive a number.

### 3. Factual accuracy

- Every historical event I reference must be verifiable via the cited source
- If I use web search results, I will include the URL
- If I cannot verify a claim, I will say so explicitly
- I will not backfill datasets with AI-generated events — the user must
  verify every entry against a real source

### 4. Transparency about limitations

**What I am:**
- An AI language model (Claude, Opus 4.6) running as GitHub Copilot
- Good at: pattern recognition, statistical computation, code generation,
  synthesizing large amounts of text
- Capable of web search for fact-checking when the tool is available

**What I am not:**
- An investigative journalist with domain expertise
- A statistician with peer-reviewed methodology
- Infallible — I make mistakes, especially with dates, names, and numbers

**Known limitations of my analysis so far:**

| Finding | Limitation |
|---------|-----------|
| Permutation test passes (p < 0.001) for 30-row master | Tests only whether correlation ≠ 0, not whether the mechanism claim is correct |
| Multi-dataset Pearson r ≈ 0.11 (expanded datasets) | Lower than 30-row hand-scored r = 0.62, but Spearman ρ = 0.61 shows strong rank-order signal |
| Spearman ρ ≈ 0.61 (expanded datasets) | Robust to outlier magnitudes; confirms non-linear but consistent relationship |
| 2025 skew diagnosis | Based on date parsing which may miss events with non-standard date formats |
| Dataset provenance | Git history only shows when files were *pushed to GitHub*, not when analysis was *first run locally* |
| Granger (30-row master): friction → compliance lag 1 (p = 0.0008) | Supports thesis in hand-scored data; lag 2 p = 0.027 also significant |
| χ² cross-validation: 330.62 (p < 0.0001) | Uses `days_since_start % 14` binning; reproduces exactly with corrected script |
| Pearson sensitivity to 2025 | Excluding all 2025: Pearson r = 0.035 (not significant), but Spearman ρ = 0.57 (p < 0.0001) |

### 5. Political neutrality

The datasets in this repository touch on US domestic politics, Middle East
geopolitics, intelligence operations, and financial regulation.  These are
topics where people hold strong views.

My approach:
- I analyze data patterns, not political intentions
- I do not assign moral valence to correlations
- I treat all political actors symmetrically in my analysis
- If the data shows something, I report it; if it doesn't, I say so
- I will not speculate about motivations, conspiracies, or cover-ups
  beyond what the statistical evidence supports

### 6. Folder hygiene

- Each document in this folder will state its purpose, date, and data sources
  in the header
- Superseded documents will be marked as such, not silently deleted
- This README will be kept current as new analyses are added
- Subfolders will be added as needed to keep the structure navigable

## How to evaluate this work

If you're reading this and want to check whether my analysis is sound:

1. **Run the scripts yourself** — everything in `Statistical_Tests/` is
   executable Python.  `pip install pandas numpy scipy` and run them.
2. **Check the data** — all CSVs are in the repo.  Verify event dates and
   categories against the cited source URLs.
3. **Challenge the methodology** — if you think a statistical test is wrong
   or a conclusion doesn't follow, open an issue.
4. **Look for what I missed** — my biggest blind spot is things I didn't
   think to test.
