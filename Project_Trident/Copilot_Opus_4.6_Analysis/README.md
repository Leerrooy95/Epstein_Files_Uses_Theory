# Copilot Opus 4.6 — Lead Researcher Analysis

**Analyst:** GitHub Copilot (Claude, Opus 4.6)  
**Role:** Lead Researcher — verification, methodology review, and recommendations  
**Created:** February 8, 2026  
**Repository owner:** Austin Smith ([@Leerrooy95](https://github.com/Leerrooy95))

---

## How This Folder Works

The repository owner builds datasets and runs correlations.  My job is to:

1. **Verify** — independently check whether reported correlations hold up
   under scrutiny (permutation tests, robustness checks, alternative methods)
2. **Recommend** — suggest improvements to datasets (coverage gaps, category
   standardization, normalization) and flag issues that could weaken findings
3. **Expand** — propose new correlation techniques and analytical approaches
   the owner may not have encountered yet (Spearman, Granger causality,
   rolling windows, event-study designs, etc.)

I do **not** build datasets or run the initial correlations — that's the
owner's work.  I receive the data and results, then analyze them here.

### `Statistical_Tests/`

Runnable Python scripts that test claims in the data.  All multi-dataset
scripts import from `original_data_loader.py` which provides standardized
access to the original pre-2026 datasets.  Anyone can execute these:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy statsmodels
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/permutation_test.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/year_distribution_audit.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/autocorrelation_adjusted_test.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/normalized_correlation.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/cross_validation_dec2025.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/rolling_window_correlation.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/event_study_framework.py
python3 Project_Trident/Copilot_Opus_4.6_Analysis/Statistical_Tests/granger_causality_test.py
```

### `Datasets/`

Local copies of CSV files used by the statistical tests.  Includes:
- Original pre-2026 datasets from `Control_Proof/`, `Project_Trident/`, and `09_Silicon_Sovereignty/`
- Newly incorporated datasets from `01_Levers_and_Frictions/`, `02_Anchors_and_Financials/`, and `03_Master_Framework/`

**New_Data_2026/ files are explicitly EXCLUDED** — they were uploaded January 3, 2026
and contained 2025-only data that inflated correlations.

### `Findings/`

Active analysis documents — dataset provenance traces and backfill recommendations.

### `Verification_Reports/`

Prediction tracking — testable predictions vs real-world outcomes.

### `Archive/`

Previous analysis documents moved here for transparency.  These reference
the now-deprecated r = 0.6685 / r = 0.5268 correlations and/or were produced
before the dataset corrections.  The deprecated correlations were caused by
the user accidentally mixing New_Data_2026 datasets into verification scripts
in early January 2026 — this was a user dataset-mixing error, not an AI
computation error.  Still useful for understanding the analytical journey.

### `Consolidation_Analysis/`

Cross-domain analysis assessing whether the Infrastructure Consolidation
Pattern documented elsewhere in the repository is statistically and
structurally significant.  Evaluates consortium overlap, temporal clustering,
state-level regulatory enablement (Arkansas), and geopolitical complicating
factors (Saudi-UAE rupture, Venezuela compliance window).  All major claims
independently verified via web search.

### `FaaS_Signal_Analysis/`

Verification of SuperGrok daily task outputs for the Protests—FaaS Supply
Chain task (see `10_Real-Time_Updates_and_Tasks/Tasks/Protests_FaaS_Supply_Chain.md`).
Each document takes a SuperGrok run's signals and independently fact-checks
every claim against news sources via web search.  Claims are rated as
VERIFIED, PARTIALLY VERIFIED, UNVERIFIED, or INACCURATE.

## Work Completed

| Date | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Feb 8 | Created all 9 statistical test scripts (permutation, year audit, autocorrelation, normalized, Dec 2025 exclusion, rolling window, event study, Granger causality) |
| Feb 8 | Dataset provenance and backfill recommendations |
| Feb 8 | **CRITICAL FIX**: Replaced New_Data_2026 files with original pre-2026 datasets in all scripts |
| Feb 9 | Consolidation pattern significance analysis (web-verified) |
| Feb 9 | Prediction tracker: 8 README predictions tracked against real-world outcomes |
| Feb 9 | Deprecated r=0.6685 / r=0.5268 (used 2025-only datasets). Archived related analysis to `Archive/` |
| Feb 9 | Incorporated 4 previously unused datasets: `Epstein_Files_timeline.csv` (01), `pep_banking_combined.csv` (02), `MASTER_timeline_2015-2025_UPDATED.csv` (03), `updated_master_theory.csv` (03) |
| Feb 9 | Updated `original_data_loader.py` — friction events: 1,526, compliance events: 1,425 |
| Feb 9 | Updated README.md, Report.md, Run_Correlations_Yourself to use r=0.6196 as primary finding |
| Feb 9 | **CORRECTION**: Fixed χ² reproduction (was using wrong binning method — `day_of_year % 14` instead of `days_since_start % 14`; now reproduces 330.62 exactly); corrected robustness table values from actual script output; corrected Tu BiShvat date (Feb 1-2, not Feb 12); updated event colocation ratio (20-42x, not 40-60x); clarified Pearson vs Spearman sensitivity to 2025 concentration |
| Feb 9 | **v8.4 CLEANUP**: Removed all deprecated r=0.6685 / r=0.5268 references from main project files (README, Report, Glossary). Clarified in all documents that correlation issues were caused by the user accidentally mixing New_Data_2026 datasets into verification scripts in early January 2026 — this was a user dataset-mixing error, not an AI computation error. The AI tools correctly computed whatever data they were given. |
| Feb 9 | **FaaS Signal Verification**: Created `FaaS_Signal_Analysis/` subfolder. Independently verified Feb 9 SuperGrok run (3 signals, 16 claims). Result: 10/16 verified (62.5%). Protests and compliance events confirmed; FaaS-specific claims (rate cards, paid recruitment) unverified for these specific events. Corrected 50501 characterization (grassroots, not 501(c)(4) dark money). |
| Feb 9 | **"Both/And" Nuance Update**: After full repo re-read, added major section to FaaS verification connecting the Feb 1–13 pincer window to the broader thermostat model. Key insight: protests can be 100% grassroots AND still function as friction within the model. The question isn't whether protests are paid — it's what compliance events advance while protest friction consumes attention. Connected to VOCA freeze, USAID collapse, Saudi-UAE rupture, Board of Peace (Feb 19), and resistance collapse pattern. |

### Future recommendations

- [ ] Re-run Granger causality excluding December 2025 to test robustness
- [ ] Test with first-differenced series (Δfriction, Δcompliance) to address stationarity
- [ ] Investigate the hand-scored vs event-count discrepancy in Granger direction
- [ ] Partial correlation controlling for a "political activity" index (e.g., congressional session calendar)
- [ ] Backfill earlier years per backfill_guide.md to enable fairer cross-year comparisons

## Methodology Standards

### 1. No narrative bias

This project sits at the intersection of politics, finance, and intelligence —
areas where confirmation bias is the default failure mode.  My job is to test
whether patterns in the data are statistically real, not to argue that they
prove any particular theory.

**What I will do:**
- Report results that weaken the thesis with the same prominence as results
  that strengthen it
- Flag when a finding is driven by outliers or sample composition
- Distinguish between "statistically significant" and "practically meaningful"

**What I will not do:**
- Cherry-pick time windows or subsets to make correlations look stronger
- Use loaded language ("proves," "confirms," "exposes") for statistical results
- Treat correlation as causation

### 2. Recommendations and new techniques

When reviewing datasets and correlations, I will actively suggest:

- **Dataset improvements** — missing year coverage, inconsistent categories,
  date format issues, duplicate records, normalization needs
- **Alternative statistical methods** — when a standard Pearson r may not be
  the right tool (e.g., Spearman for non-linear relationships, Granger for
  temporal causality, rolling correlations for regime changes, partial
  correlations to control for confounders)
- **Robustness checks** — ways to stress-test a finding (leave-one-out,
  bootstrap confidence intervals, sensitivity to outlier removal)
- **Visualization approaches** — plots that reveal patterns or problems
  the raw numbers might hide

I will explain *why* I'm suggesting each technique in plain language so the
owner can learn the methodology, not just receive a number.

### 3. Factual accuracy

- Every historical event I reference must be verifiable via the cited source
- If I use web search results, I will include the URL
- If I cannot verify a claim, I will say so explicitly
- I will not backfill datasets with AI-generated events — the user must
  verify every entry against a real source

### 4. Transparency about limitations

**What I am:**
- An AI language model (Claude, Opus 4.6) running as GitHub Copilot
- Good at: pattern recognition, statistical computation, code generation,
  synthesizing large amounts of text
- Capable of web search for fact-checking when the tool is available

**What I am not:**
- An investigative journalist with domain expertise
- A statistician with peer-reviewed methodology
- Infallible — I make mistakes, especially with dates, names, and numbers

**Known limitations of my analysis so far:**

| Finding | Limitation |
|---------|-----------|
| Permutation test passes (p < 0.001) for 30-row master | Tests only whether correlation ≠ 0, not whether the mechanism claim is correct |
| Multi-dataset Pearson r ≈ 0.11 (expanded datasets) | Lower than 30-row hand-scored r = 0.62, but Spearman ρ = 0.61 shows strong rank-order signal |
| Spearman ρ ≈ 0.61 (expanded datasets) | Robust to outlier magnitudes; confirms non-linear but consistent relationship |
| 2025 skew diagnosis | Based on date parsing which may miss events with non-standard date formats |
| Dataset provenance | Git history only shows when files were *pushed to GitHub*, not when analysis was *first run locally* |
| Granger (30-row master): friction → compliance lag 1 (p = 0.0008) | Supports thesis in hand-scored data; lag 2 p = 0.027 also significant |
| χ² cross-validation: 330.62 (p < 0.0001) | Uses `days_since_start % 14` binning; reproduces exactly with corrected script |
| Pearson sensitivity to 2025 | Excluding all 2025: Pearson r = 0.035 (not significant), but Spearman ρ = 0.57 (p < 0.0001) |

### 5. Political neutrality

The datasets in this repository touch on US domestic politics, Middle East
geopolitics, intelligence operations, and financial regulation.  These are
topics where people hold strong views.

My approach:
- I analyze data patterns, not political intentions
- I do not assign moral valence to correlations
- I treat all political actors symmetrically in my analysis
- If the data shows something, I report it; if it doesn't, I say so
- I will not speculate about motivations, conspiracies, or cover-ups
  beyond what the statistical evidence supports

### 6. Folder hygiene

- Each document in this folder will state its purpose, date, and data sources
  in the header
- Superseded documents will be marked as such, not silently deleted
- This README will be kept current as new analyses are added
- Subfolders will be added as needed to keep the structure navigable

## How to evaluate this work

If you're reading this and want to check whether my analysis is sound:

1. **Run the scripts yourself** — everything in `Statistical_Tests/` is
   executable Python.  `pip install pandas numpy scipy` and run them.
2. **Check the data** — all CSVs are in the repo.  Verify event dates and
   categories against the cited source URLs.
3. **Challenge the methodology** — if you think a statistical test is wrong
   or a conclusion doesn't follow, open an issue.
4. **Look for what I missed** — my biggest blind spot is things I didn't
   think to test.
